## Events and probability

- An **event** is a set of outcomes.
- Probability is a number between 0 and 1.

Example: probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck is 26/52 = 0.5.

## Conditional probability

Probability of A given B:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]

In analytics language:

- A = “user churns”
- B = “user is on basic plan”

Then \(P(A|B)\) is the churn rate for basic-plan users.

## Independence

A and B are independent if:

\[ P(A|B) = P(A) \]

If churn rate differs by plan, churn and plan are **not** independent.

## Bayes’ rule

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Common use cases:

- Medical tests (false positives)
- Fraud detection (base rate is tiny)

## Mini example: base rate fallacy

If fraud is rare (say 0.1%), even a “95% accurate” detector can generate many false alarms.

Key lesson:

- Always check base rates and precision/recall, not just accuracy.

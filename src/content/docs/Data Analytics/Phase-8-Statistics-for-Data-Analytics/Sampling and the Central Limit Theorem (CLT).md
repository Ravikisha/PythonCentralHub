## Sampling

A sample is one possible view of the population.

Important ideas:

- Larger samples reduce noise.
- Random sampling reduces bias.

## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

CLT says (informally):

> For many distributions, the distribution of the **sample mean** becomes approximately normal as sample size grows.

This enables:

- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis tests

## Demonstration in Python

Even if data is not normal (e.g., exponential), the means become close to normal.

```python title="CLT demo" showLineNumbers{1}
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng(42)

# Non-normal population
population = rng.exponential(scale=1.0, size=200_000)

means = []
for _ in range(5000):
    sample = rng.choice(population, size=50, replace=False)
    means.append(sample.mean())

means = np.array(means)
print(means.mean(), means.std())
```

## Standard error

The **standard error of the mean** is:

\[ SE(\bar{x}) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \]

- Bigger n → smaller SE

## Practical guidance

- Use bootstrap (resampling) if formulas are hard or assumptions unclear.

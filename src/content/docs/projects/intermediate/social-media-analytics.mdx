## Code Explanation

### Database Schema Design
```python title="socialmediaanalytics.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def init_database(self):
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS posts (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            platform TEXT NOT NULL,
            post_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            content TEXT,
            author TEXT,
            timestamp DATETIME,
            likes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
            shares INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
            comments INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
            engagement_rate REAL DEFAULT 0,
            sentiment_score REAL DEFAULT 0,
            sentiment_label TEXT,
            hashtags TEXT,
            mentions TEXT
        )
    ''')
```

Creates comprehensive database schema for multi-platform social media data with engagement metrics.

### Social Media API Integration
```python title="socialmediaanalytics.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def fetch_twitter_data(self, username, count=100):
    tweets = tweepy.Cursor(
        self.twitter_api.user_timeline,
        screen_name=username,
        include_rts=False,
        tweet_mode='extended'
    ).items(count)
    
    for tweet in tweets:
        sentiment = TextBlob(tweet.full_text).sentiment
        hashtags = [tag['text'] for tag in tweet.entities['hashtags']]
        
        post_data = {
            'platform': 'twitter',
            'content': tweet.full_text,
            'likes': tweet.favorite_count,
            'shares': tweet.retweet_count,
            'sentiment_score': sentiment.polarity,
            'hashtags': json.dumps(hashtags)
        }
```

Integrates with Twitter API for real-time data collection with automatic sentiment analysis.

### Sentiment Analysis Engine
```python title="socialmediaanalytics.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def analyze_sentiment_trends(self, platform=None, days=30):
    query = '''
        SELECT 
            platform,
            DATE(timestamp) as date,
            sentiment_label,
            COUNT(*) as count,
            AVG(sentiment_score) as avg_sentiment
        FROM posts 
        WHERE timestamp >= date('now', '-{} days')
        GROUP BY platform, DATE(timestamp), sentiment_label
    '''.format(days)
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
    return df
```

Analyzes sentiment trends over time with platform-specific insights and scoring.

### Engagement Pattern Analysis
```python title="socialmediaanalytics.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def analyze_engagement_patterns(self, platform=None, days=30):
    query = '''
        SELECT 
            platform,
            DATE(timestamp) as date,
            AVG(engagement_rate) as avg_engagement,
            SUM(likes) as total_likes,
            SUM(shares) as total_shares,
            SUM(comments) as total_comments,
            COUNT(*) as post_count
        FROM posts 
        WHERE timestamp >= date('now', '-{} days')
        GROUP BY platform, DATE(timestamp)
    '''.format(days)
```

Tracks engagement patterns across platforms with comprehensive metrics and trends.

### Hashtag Performance Analytics
```python title="socialmediaanalytics.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def analyze_hashtag_performance(self, platform=None, limit=20):
    for hashtags_json, engagement, likes, shares, comments in results:
        hashtags = json.loads(hashtags_json)
        for hashtag in hashtags:
            hashtag_stats[hashtag]['usage_count'] += 1
            hashtag_stats[hashtag]['total_engagement'] += engagement
            hashtag_stats[hashtag]['avg_engagement'] = stats['total_engagement'] / stats['usage_count']
    
    sorted_hashtags = sorted(hashtag_stats.items(), 
                           key=lambda x: (x[1]['avg_engagement'], x[1]['usage_count']), 
                           reverse=True)
```

Analyzes hashtag effectiveness with usage frequency and engagement correlation.

### AI Recommendations Engine
```python title="socialmediaanalytics.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def generate_recommendations(self):
    recommendations = {
        'content_strategy': [],
        'posting_schedule': [],
        'hashtag_strategy': [],
        'engagement_tactics': []
    }
    
    if insights.get('avg_engagement_by_sentiment'):
        best_sentiment = max(insights['avg_engagement_by_sentiment'].items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
        recommendations['content_strategy'].append(
            f"Focus on {best_sentiment[0]} content - it has {best_sentiment[1]:.1f}% higher engagement"
        )
```

Generates AI-powered recommendations based on performance data analysis and trends.

### Interactive Web Dashboard
```python title="socialmediaanalytics.py" showLineNumbers{1}
@self.app.route('/api/engagement-chart')
def api_engagement_chart():
    df = self.analytics_api.analyze_engagement_patterns(days=30)
    
    fig = px.line(df, x='date', y='avg_engagement', color='platform',
                 title='Engagement Rate Over Time')
    
    graphJSON = json.dumps(fig, cls=PlotlyJSONEncoder)
    return graphJSON
```

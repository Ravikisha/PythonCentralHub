## Abstract

Build a Basic E-commerce Website that displays products, allows adding to a shopping cart, and calculates the total price. The app uses Flask for web development and provides a simple web interface. This project demonstrates web development, routing, and template rendering in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Familiarity with Flask for web development
- Knowledge of HTML templates

## Getting Started
### Creating a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `ecommerce_website`.
2. Create a new file inside the folder and name it `ecommerce_website.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into the `ecommerce_website.py` file.

### Write the code
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/ecommerce_website.py" lang="python" title="ecommerce_website.py" showLineNumbers={1} />

## Key Features
- Display a list of products
- Add products to a shopping cart
- Calculate total price
- Web interface using Flask and HTML templates

## Explanation

### Displaying Products
Products are stored in a list of dictionaries and rendered using Flask templates:
```python title="ecommerce_website.py" showLineNumbers={1}
products = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Laptop", "price": 800},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Smartphone", "price": 500},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Headphones", "price": 100},
    {"id": 4, "name": "Keyboard", "price": 50},
]
```

### Adding to Cart
Users can add products to the cart, which is stored in a list:
```python title="ecommerce_website.py" showLineNumbers={1}
cart.append(product)
```

### Viewing Cart and Total Price
The cart and total price are displayed using Flask templates:
```python title="ecommerce_website.py" showLineNumbers={1}
total_price = sum(item['price'] for item in cart)
return render_template('cart.html', cart=cart, total_price=total_price)
```

## Running the Application
1. Save the file.
2. Install Flask:
```bash
pip install flask
```
3. Run the application:
```bash
python ecommerce_website.py
```

## Conclusion
This Basic E-commerce Website project is a great way to learn about web development and routing in Python. You can extend it by adding user authentication, product search, or payment integration.

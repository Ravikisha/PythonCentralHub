## Abstract
URL Expander is a Python project that takes shortened URLs and expands them to their original form. It demonstrates API usage, HTTP requests, and GUI development. This project is ideal for learning about web APIs, networking, and user interaction.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- requests (`pip install requests`)
- tkinter (usually pre-installed)

## Before you Start
Install Python and requests. Prepare a list of shortened URLs for testing.

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `url-expander`.
2. Create a file named `url_expander.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/url_expander.py" lang="python" title="URL Expander" />
4. Run the script: `python url_expander.py`

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import required modules.**
```python
import requests
import tkinter as tk
```
2. **Expand shortened URL.**
```python
response = requests.head(short_url, allow_redirects=True)
expanded_url = response.url
```
3. **Display result in GUI.**
```python
root = tk.Tk()
root.title('URL Expander')
# ...setup widgets for input and display...
root.mainloop()
```

## Features
- Expands shortened URLs
- GUI for user interaction
- Easy to extend for more features

## How It Works
- User enters shortened URL
- App expands and displays original URL

## GUI Components
- **Entry box:** For URL input
- **Button:** Expands URL
- **Label:** Shows expanded URL

## Use Cases
- Reveal original links
- Learn API and HTTP requests
- Build web utilities

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Supporting batch expansion
- Logging expanded URLs
- Improving GUI design
- Adding URL validation

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def expand_batch():
    # Expand multiple URLs at once
    pass

def log_expansions():
    # Save expanded URLs to file
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Invalid URL:** Check input format
- **No expansion:** Check internet connection
- **GUI not showing:** Ensure Tkinter is installed

## Conclusion
This project teaches API usage, HTTP requests, and GUI basics. Extend it for more features and better user experience.

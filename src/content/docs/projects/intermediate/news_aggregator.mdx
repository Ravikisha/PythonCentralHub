## Abstract
News Aggregator is a Python application that fetches and displays the latest news headlines from multiple sources using public APIs. It demonstrates API integration, data parsing, and GUI development with Tkinter. This project is ideal for learning about REST APIs, JSON handling, and building interactive desktop apps.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- requests module (`pip install requests`)
- tkinter (usually pre-installed)
- Internet connection

## Before you Start
Before starting, ensure you have Python and a code editor installed. Install the `requests` library using `pip install requests`. Obtain a free API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `news-aggregator`.
2. Create a file named `news_aggregator.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/news_aggregator.py" lang="python" title="News Aggregator" />
4. Run the script: `python news_aggregator.py`

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import modules**
```python
import requests
import tkinter as tk
```
2. **Fetch news from API**
```python
def fetch_news():
    url = 'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY'
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return [article['title'] for article in data['articles']]
```
3. **Display headlines in GUI**
```python
root = tk.Tk()
root.title('News Aggregator')
listbox = tk.Listbox(root, width=80)
listbox.pack(pady=20)
for headline in fetch_news():
    listbox.insert(tk.END, headline)
root.mainloop()
```

## Features
- Fetches latest headlines from multiple sources
- Simple Tkinter GUI for display
- Easy to extend for more sources
- Demonstrates API and JSON usage

## How It Works
- Uses requests to call news API
- Parses JSON response
- Displays headlines in a listbox

## GUI Components
- **Listbox:** Shows headlines
- **Window Title:** News Aggregator
- **Padding:** For readability

## Use Cases
- Stay updated with news
- Learn API integration
- Build custom news dashboards

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding more news sources
- Displaying summaries and images
- Implementing search/filter
- Saving favorite articles
- Adding refresh button
- Supporting multiple countries/languages

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def fetch_news_with_images():
    # Fetch headlines and images
    pass

def search_news(query):
    # Search for news by keyword
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **API key errors:** Check your key
- **No headlines:** Check internet connection
- **GUI not showing:** Ensure Tkinter is installed

## Conclusion
This project teaches API usage, JSON parsing, and GUI basics. Extend it for more features and sources. Great for learning real-world Python and desktop app development.

## Abstract
Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe is a Python project that allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe over a network. It demonstrates socket programming, game logic, and GUI development. This project is ideal for learning about multiplayer games, networking, and event-driven programming.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- socket, threading (built-in)
- tkinter (for GUI, usually pre-installed)

## Before you Start
Ensure Python is installed. No external packages are required. For GUI, make sure Tkinter is available.

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `tic-tac-toe`.
2. Create a file named `multiplayer_tic_tac_toe.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/multiplayer_tic_tac_toe.py" lang="python" title="Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe" />
4. Run the server and client scripts as described in the code comments.

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import modules**
```python
import socket
import threading
import tkinter as tk
```
2. **Server and client setup**
```python
def start_server():
    # Accepts connections and relays moves
    pass

def start_client():
    # Connects to server and sends/receives moves
    pass
```
3. **Game logic and GUI**
```python
root = tk.Tk()
root.title('Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe')
# ...setup grid for game board...
root.mainloop()
```

## Features
- Two-player networked game
- Real-time move updates
- GUI for game board
- Demonstrates sockets and threading

## How It Works
- Server relays moves between clients
- Clients send/receive moves
- GUI displays board and handles input

## GUI Components
- **Grid:** Buttons for each cell
- **Status display:** Shows turn and winner

## Use Cases
- Learn networking basics
- Build multiplayer games
- Practice game logic

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding chat feature
- Supporting AI opponent
- Improving GUI design
- Keeping score history

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def add_chat():
    # Allow players to chat
    pass

def add_ai_opponent():
    # Play against computer
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Connection errors:** Check IP and port
- **GUI not showing:** Ensure Tkinter is installed
- **Moves not sent:** Check server/client status

## Conclusion
This project teaches networking, game logic, and GUI basics. Extend it for more features and better user experience.

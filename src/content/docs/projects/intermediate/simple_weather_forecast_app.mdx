## Abstract
Simple Weather Forecast App is a Python project that fetches and displays weather forecasts for a given city. It demonstrates API integration, data parsing, and GUI development. This project is ideal for learning about REST APIs, JSON handling, and interactive desktop apps.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- requests (`pip install requests`)
- tkinter (usually pre-installed)

## Before you Start
Install Python and requests. Obtain a free API key from a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `weather-forecast-app`.
2. Create a file named `simple_weather_forecast_app.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/simple_weather_forecast_app.py" lang="python" title="Simple Weather Forecast App" />
4. Run the script: `python simple_weather_forecast_app.py`

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import modules**
```python
import requests
import tkinter as tk
```
2. **Fetch weather data**
```python
def get_forecast(city):
    # Fetch weather data from API
    pass
```
3. **GUI for forecast display**
```python
root = tk.Tk()
root.title('Weather Forecast App')
# ...setup widgets for city input and forecast display...
root.mainloop()
```

## Features
- Fetches weather forecast from API
- GUI for display
- Easy to extend for more features

## How It Works
- User enters city name
- App fetches and displays forecast

## GUI Components
- **Label:** Shows forecast info
- **Entry box:** For city input
- **Button:** Fetches forecast

## Use Cases
- Daily weather updates
- Learn API integration
- Build custom weather dashboards

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding more weather details
- Supporting multiple cities
- Improving GUI design
- Adding charts or graphs

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def add_graphs():
    # Display weather trends
    pass

def support_multiple_cities():
    # Show forecasts for several cities
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **API key errors:** Check your key
- **No forecast displayed:** Check city name and internet connection
- **GUI not showing:** Ensure Tkinter is installed

## Conclusion
This project teaches API usage, JSON parsing, and GUI basics. Extend it for more features and better user experience.

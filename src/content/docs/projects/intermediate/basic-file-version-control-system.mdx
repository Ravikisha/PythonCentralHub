## Abstract

Build a Basic File Version Control System that tracks changes to files, allows committing changes with messages, and reverting to previous versions. This project demonstrates file hashing, serialization, and command-line interaction in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Knowledge of file handling and hashing
- Familiarity with serialization (pickle)

## Getting Started
### Creating a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `basic_file_version_control_system`.
2. Create a new file inside the folder and name it `basic_file_version_control_system.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into the `basic_file_version_control_system.py` file.

### Write the code
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/basic_file_version_control_system.py" lang="python" title="basic_file_version_control_system.py" showLineNumbers={1} />

## Key Features
- Track changes to files
- Commit changes with messages
- Revert to previous versions
- Command-line interface for user interaction

## Explanation

### File Hashing
The app uses SHA-256 to hash file contents for change detection:
```python title="basic_file_version_control_system.py" showLineNumbers={1}
hasher = hashlib.sha256()
with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
    hasher.update(f.read())
```

### Committing Changes
Changes are committed with a message and stored in a serialized file:
```python title="basic_file_version_control_system.py" showLineNumbers={1}
version_data = {
    "hash": file_hash,
    "timestamp": timestamp,
    "message": message,
    "content": open(file_path, "rb").read(),
}
self.versions[file_name] = version_data
with open(self.version_file, "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(self.versions, f)
```

### Reverting and Logging
Users can revert files to previous versions and view commit logs:
```python title="basic_file_version_control_system.py" showLineNumbers={1}
def revert(self, file_name):
    # Restore file from self.versions

def log(self, file_name):
    # Print commit history
```

## Running the Application
1. Save the file.
2. Run the application:
```bash
python basic_file_version_control_system.py
```

## Conclusion
This Basic File Version Control System project is a great way to learn about file tracking and serialization in Python. You can extend it by adding branching, remote repositories, or a GUI interface.

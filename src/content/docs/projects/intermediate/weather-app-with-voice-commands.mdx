## Abstract

Build a Weather App that fetches weather information based on voice commands. The app uses speech recognition to capture user queries and displays weather data from an API. This project demonstrates API integration, speech recognition, and GUI development in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Familiarity with Tkinter for GUI development
- Knowledge of speech recognition and API requests

## Getting Started
### Creating a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `weather_app_with_voice_commands`.
2. Create a new file inside the folder and name it `weather_app_with_voice_commands.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into the `weather_app_with_voice_commands.py` file.

### Write the code
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/weather_app_with_voice_commands.py" lang="python" title="weather_app_with_voice_commands.py" showLineNumbers={1} />

## Key Features
- Voice recognition to capture city names
- Fetch weather data from an API
- Display weather information in a user-friendly format
- GUI interface for user interaction

## Explanation

### Speech Recognition
The app uses the `speech_recognition` library to capture voice input:
```python title="weather_app_with_voice_commands.py" showLineNumbers={1}
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    city = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
```

### Fetching Weather Data
Weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API:
```python title="weather_app_with_voice_commands.py" showLineNumbers={1}
params = {"q": city, "appid": API_KEY, "units": "metric"}
response = requests.get(BASE_URL, params=params)
```

### Displaying Results
Weather information is shown in a Tkinter Label widget:
```python title="weather_app_with_voice_commands.py" showLineNumbers={1}
self.result_label.config(text=f"Weather: {weather}\nTemperature: {temp}Â°C")
```

## Running the Application
1. Save the file.
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install speechrecognition requests
```
3. Run the application:
```bash
python weather_app_with_voice_commands.py
```

## Conclusion
This Weather App with Voice Commands project is a great way to learn about API integration and speech recognition in Python. You can extend it by adding support for more languages, weather forecasts, or voice feedback.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system is built with several interconnected components:

```python title="webscrapingpipeline.py" showLineNumbers{1}
class RateLimiter:
    """Implements domain-specific rate limiting for respectful scraping."""
    
    def __init__(self, max_requests=10, time_window=60):
        self.max_requests = max_requests
        self.time_window = time_window
        self.requests = defaultdict(deque)
    
    def is_allowed(self, domain):
        """Check if request to domain is allowed based on rate limit."""
        # Rate limiting logic with time window tracking

class WebScraper:
    """Main scraping engine with support for multiple extraction methods."""
    
    def scrape_url(self, url, scraping_config):
        """Scrape a single URL with given configuration."""
        # Robots.txt checking, rate limiting, and data extraction
        
    def _extract_data(self, html_content, extraction_rules):
        """Extract data using CSS selectors, regex, and XPath."""
        # BeautifulSoup-based data extraction with multiple rule types

class DataProcessor:
    """Advanced data processing and validation engine."""
    
    def process_scraped_data(self, raw_data, processing_rules):
        """Process raw scraped data using configurable rules."""
        # Text cleaning, sentiment analysis, and data transformation

class ScrapingScheduler:
    """Automated scheduling system for scraping projects."""
    
    def _run_scraping_project(self, project_id):
        """Execute a scheduled scraping project."""
        # Project execution with logging and data storage
```

## 💾 Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with a comprehensive schema:

```python title="webscrapingpipeline.py" showLineNumbers{35}
def init_database(self):
    """Create database tables for web scraping pipeline."""
    
    # Scraping projects - project configurations
    # Scraped data - extracted and processed data
    # Scraping logs - execution history and monitoring
    # Validation rules - data quality enforcement
    # Monitoring alerts - automated notifications
    # Exported reports - export history tracking
    # Site metadata - robots.txt and crawl policies
```

## 🔧 Core Features

### 1. Intelligent Web Scraping

```python title="webscrapingpipeline.py" showLineNumbers{200}
def scrape_url(self, url, scraping_config):
    """Comprehensive URL scraping with multiple safeguards."""
    
    # Check robots.txt compliance
    if not self.check_robots_txt(url):
        return {'status': 'skipped', 'error': 'Robots.txt disallows crawling'}
    
    # Apply rate limiting
    domain = urlparse(url).netloc
    if not self.rate_limiter.is_allowed(domain):
        wait_time = self.rate_limiter.wait_time(domain)
        return {'status': 'rate_limited', 'error': f'Rate limited. Wait {wait_time:.1f} seconds'}
    
    # Choose appropriate scraping method
    if scraping_config.get('use_selenium', False):
        response_data = self._scrape_with_selenium(url, scraping_config)
    else:
        response_data = self._scrape_with_requests(url, scraping_config)
```

### 2. Advanced Data Processing

```python title="webscrapingpipeline.py" showLineNumbers{400}
def process_scraped_data(self, raw_data, processing_rules):
    """Multi-stage data processing pipeline."""
    
    processed_data = {}
    
    for field_name, value in raw_data.items():
        if field_name in processing_rules:
            # Apply text cleaning, sentiment analysis, validation
            processed_data[field_name] = self._apply_processing_rules(
                value, processing_rules[field_name]
            )
        else:
            processed_data[field_name] = value
    
    # Calculate derived fields (concatenation, calculations)
    if 'derived_fields' in processing_rules:
        for derived_field, rule in processing_rules['derived_fields'].items():
            processed_data[derived_field] = self._calculate_derived_field(processed_data, rule)
```

### 3. Automated Scheduling

```python title="webscrapingpipeline.py" showLineNumbers{550}
def _schedule_project(self, project_id, project_name, schedule_config):
    """Configure automated project scheduling."""
    
    if schedule_config['type'] == 'interval':
        if schedule_config['unit'] == 'minutes':
            schedule.every(schedule_config['value']).minutes.do(
                self._run_scraping_project, project_id
            )
        elif schedule_config['unit'] == 'hours':
            schedule.every(schedule_config['value']).hours.do(
                self._run_scraping_project, project_id
            )
    elif schedule_config['type'] == 'daily':
        schedule.every().day.at(schedule_config['time']).do(
            self._run_scraping_project, project_id
        )
```

### 4. Comprehensive Analytics

```python title="webscrapingpipeline.py" showLineNumbers{650}
def generate_project_report(self, project_id, days_back=30):
    """Generate detailed project performance report."""
    
    # Get scraping statistics
    stats = pd.read_sql_query('''
        SELECT 
            COUNT(*) as total_attempts,
            SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful_scrapes,
            AVG(execution_time) as avg_execution_time,
            MAX(execution_time) as max_execution_time
        FROM scraping_logs 
        WHERE project_id = ? AND timestamp >= ?
    ''', conn, params=[project_id, start_date])
    
    # Analyze daily trends, error patterns, and data quality
    return comprehensive_report
```

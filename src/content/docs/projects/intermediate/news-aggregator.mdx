## Abstract

Build a News Aggregator application that fetches and displays news articles from multiple sources using RSS feeds. The app categorizes news by topic, allows searching for articles, and lets users save favorites for later reading. This project demonstrates working with external APIs, parsing XML, and building a GUI in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Knowledge of HTTP requests and RSS/XML parsing
- Familiarity with Tkinter for GUI development

## Getting Started
### Creating a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `news_aggregator`.
2. Create a new file inside the folder and name it `news_aggregator.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into the `news_aggregator.py` file.

### Write the code
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/news_aggregator.py" lang="python" title="news_aggregator.py" showLineNumbers={1} />

## Key Features
- Fetch news articles from multiple RSS feeds
- Categorize news by topic (Technology, Sports, World)
- Search for articles by keyword
- Save favorite articles for later reading
- GUI interface for easy navigation

## Explanation

### Fetching RSS Feeds
The application uses a dictionary to store RSS feed URLs for different categories. When a category is selected, the corresponding feed is fetched and parsed:
```python title="news_aggregator.py" showLineNumbers={1}
self.feeds = {
    "Technology": "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Technology.xml",
    "Sports": "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Sports.xml",
    "World": "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml",
}
```

### Displaying Articles
Articles are displayed in a Tkinter Listbox. Users can select an article to view details or save it to favorites:
```python title="news_aggregator.py" showLineNumbers={1}
self.article_list = Listbox(self.root, width=80, height=20)
self.article_list.pack(pady=5)
```

### Viewing and Saving Articles
The app provides buttons to view the selected article or save it for later:
```python title="news_aggregator.py" showLineNumbers={1}
Button(self.root, text="View Article", command=self.view_article).pack(pady=5)
Button(self.root, text="Save to Favorites", command=self.save_to_favorites).pack(pady=5)
```

## Running the Application
1. Save the file.
2. Install any required dependencies (e.g., `feedparser` for RSS parsing):
```bash
pip install feedparser
```
3. Run the application:
```bash
python news_aggregator.py
```

## Conclusion
This News Aggregator project is a great way to learn about working with external data sources, parsing XML, and building user interfaces in Python. You can extend it by adding more categories, integrating APIs, or improving the search and favorites features.

## Abstract
Basic Chatroom App is a Python project that enables real-time text communication between multiple users over a network. It demonstrates socket programming, threading, and basic GUI development. This project is ideal for learning about client-server architecture, concurrency, and event-driven programming.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- socket, threading (built-in)
- tkinter (for GUI, usually pre-installed)

## Before you Start
Ensure Python is installed. No external packages are required. For GUI, make sure Tkinter is available.

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `chatroom-app`.
2. Create a file named `basic_chatroom_app.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/basic_chatroom_app.py" lang="python" title="Basic Chatroom App" />
4. Run the server and client scripts as described in the code comments.

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import modules**
```python
import socket
import threading
import tkinter as tk
```
2. **Server setup**
```python
def start_server():
    # Accepts connections and relays messages
    pass
```
3. **Client setup**
```python
def start_client():
    # Connects to server and sends/receives messages
    pass
```
4. **GUI for chat**
```python
root = tk.Tk()
root.title('Chatroom')
# ...setup widgets for chat display and input...
root.mainloop()
```

## Features
- Real-time text chat
- Multiple users
- Simple GUI
- Demonstrates sockets and threading

## How It Works
- Server listens for connections
- Clients connect and send messages
- Messages are broadcast to all clients
- GUI displays chat and allows input

## GUI Components
- **Text area:** Shows chat history
- **Entry box:** For message input
- **Send button:** Sends message

## Use Cases
- Learn networking basics
- Build simple chat apps
- Experiment with concurrency

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding user authentication
- Supporting private messages
- Improving GUI design
- Adding emojis or file sharing
- Implementing message history

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def add_authentication():
    # Require login for chat
    pass

def save_chat_history():
    # Store messages in a file
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Connection errors:** Check IP and port
- **GUI not showing:** Ensure Tkinter is installed
- **Messages not sent:** Check server/client status

## Conclusion
This project teaches networking, threading, and GUI basics. Extend it for more features and better user experience.

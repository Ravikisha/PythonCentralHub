## Abstract
Basic OCR with Tesseract is a Python project that extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR. It demonstrates image processing, external tool integration, and automation. This project is ideal for learning about OCR, file handling, and real-world automation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- pytesseract (`pip install pytesseract`)
- Pillow (`pip install pillow`)
- Tesseract installed on your system

## Before you Start
Install Python, Tesseract, pytesseract, and Pillow. Ensure Tesseract is in your system PATH.

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `ocr-tesseract`.
2. Create a file named `basic_ocr_with_tesseract.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/basic_ocr_with_tesseract.py" lang="python" title="Basic OCR with Tesseract" />
4. Run the script: `python basic_ocr_with_tesseract.py`

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import modules**
```python
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract
```
2. **Load image and extract text**
```python
img = Image.open('sample.png')
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)
print(text)
```

## Features
- Extracts text from images
- Uses Tesseract OCR engine
- Simple CLI usage
- Easy to extend for more features

## How It Works
- Loads image file
- Passes to Tesseract for OCR
- Prints extracted text

## Use Cases
- Digitize documents
- Automate data entry
- Learn OCR basics

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Processing multiple images
- Saving text to files
- Adding a GUI
- Supporting different languages

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def process_folder():
    # OCR all images in a folder
    pass

def add_language_support():
    # Use Tesseract for other languages
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Tesseract not found:** Check installation and PATH
- **No text extracted:** Try different images

## Conclusion
This project teaches OCR, image processing, and automation. Extend it for more robust text extraction and features.

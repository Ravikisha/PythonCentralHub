## Abstract
Anagram Game is a Python project that challenges users to unscramble words. It demonstrates string manipulation, randomization, and GUI development. This project is ideal for learning about word games, event handling, and user interaction in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- random (built-in)
- tkinter (for GUI, usually pre-installed)

## Before you Start
Ensure Python is installed. No external packages are required. For GUI, make sure Tkinter is available.

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `anagram-game`.
2. Create a file named `anagram_game.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/anagram_game.py" lang="python" title="Anagram Game" />
4. Run the script: `python anagram_game.py`

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import modules**
```python
import random
import tkinter as tk
```
2. **Word selection and scrambling**
```python
words = ['python', 'algorithm', 'function', 'variable']
word = random.choice(words)
anagram = ''.join(random.sample(word, len(word)))
```
3. **GUI for game**
```python
root = tk.Tk()
root.title('Anagram Game')
# ...setup widgets for display and input...
root.mainloop()
```

## Features
- Random word selection
- Scrambled word display
- User input for guesses
- Score tracking

## How It Works
- Selects a word and scrambles it
- Displays anagram in GUI
- User enters guess
- Checks correctness and updates score

## GUI Components
- **Label:** Shows scrambled word
- **Entry box:** For user guess
- **Button:** Submits guess
- **Score display:** Tracks correct answers

## Use Cases
- Improve vocabulary
- Practice spelling
- Learn string manipulation

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding more words
- Implementing difficulty levels
- Adding timer for each round
- Keeping high scores
- Giving hints

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def add_timer():
    # Limit time for each guess
    pass

def show_hint():
    # Display a hint for the word
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **GUI not showing:** Ensure Tkinter is installed
- **No words displayed:** Check word list

## Conclusion
This project teaches string manipulation, randomization, and GUI basics. Extend it for more features and challenge levels.

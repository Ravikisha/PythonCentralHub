## Abstract

Build a Real-time Chat Application using WebSocket for real-time communication between clients. The app includes server and client implementations for sending and receiving messages. This project demonstrates WebSocket programming, concurrency, and network communication in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Familiarity with WebSocket programming
- Knowledge of asyncio for concurrency

## Getting Started
### Creating a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `real_time_chat_application`.
2. Create a new file inside the folder and name it `real_time_chat_application.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into the `real_time_chat_application.py` file.

### Write the code
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/real_time_chat_application.py" lang="python" title="real_time_chat_application.py" showLineNumbers={1} />

## Key Features
- Real-time messaging between multiple clients
- Server-side implementation using `websockets` library
- Client-side implementation for sending and receiving messages
- Concurrency using asyncio

## Explanation

### Server Implementation
The server handles incoming messages and broadcasts them to all clients:
```python title="real_time_chat_application.py" showLineNumbers={1}
async def handle_client(websocket, path):
    connected_clients.add(websocket)
    async for message in websocket:
        await broadcast(message)
```

### Broadcasting Messages
Messages are sent to all connected clients:
```python title="real_time_chat_application.py" showLineNumbers={1}
async def broadcast(message):
    await asyncio.wait([client.send(message) for client in connected_clients])
```

## Running the Application
1. Save the file.
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install websockets
```
3. Run the server:
```bash
python real_time_chat_application.py
```

## Conclusion
This Real-time Chat Application project is a great way to learn about WebSocket programming and concurrency in Python. You can extend it by adding a GUI, message history, or user authentication.

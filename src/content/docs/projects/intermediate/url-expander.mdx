## Abstract

Build a URL Expander application that expands shortened URLs to their original form. The app provides a GUI for entering URLs and displaying the expanded result. This project demonstrates HTTP requests, URL handling, and GUI development in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Familiarity with Tkinter for GUI development
- Knowledge of HTTP requests

## Getting Started
### Creating a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `url_expander`.
2. Create a new file inside the folder and name it `url_expander.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into the `url_expander.py` file.

### Write the code
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/url_expander.py" lang="python" title="url_expander.py" showLineNumbers={1} />

## Key Features
- Accept shortened URLs as input
- Display expanded URLs
- GUI interface for user interaction

## Explanation

### Expanding URLs
The app uses the `requests` library to follow redirects and expand URLs:
```python title="url_expander.py" showLineNumbers={1}
response = requests.head(short_url, allow_redirects=True)
return response.url
```

### Displaying Results
Expanded URLs are shown in a Tkinter message box:
```python title="url_expander.py" showLineNumbers={1}
messagebox.showinfo("Expanded URL", f"Original URL: {expanded_url}")
```

## Running the Application
1. Save the file.
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests
```
3. Run the application:
```bash
python url_expander.py
```

## Conclusion
This URL Expander project is a great way to learn about HTTP requests and URL handling in Python. You can extend it by adding batch expansion, URL validation, or analytics features.

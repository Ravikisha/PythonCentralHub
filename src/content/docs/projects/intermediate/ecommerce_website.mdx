## Abstract
E-commerce Website is a Python project that simulates an online store with product listings, shopping cart, and checkout functionality. It demonstrates web development, backend logic, and user interaction. This project is ideal for learning about web apps, databases, and business logic.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Flask (`pip install flask`)
- SQLite (built-in)

## Before you Start
Install Python and Flask. Prepare a sample product database for testing.

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `ecommerce-website`.
2. Create a file named `ecommerce_website.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/ecommerce_website.py" lang="python" title="E-commerce Website" />
4. Run the script: `python ecommerce_website.py`

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import required modules.**
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
import sqlite3
```
2. **Set up Flask app and database.**
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
conn = sqlite3.connect('products.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
```
3. **Define routes and logic.**
```python
@app.route('/')
def home():
    # Show product listings
    pass

@app.route('/cart')
def cart():
    # Show shopping cart
    pass

@app.route('/checkout')
def checkout():
    # Handle checkout
    pass
```
4. **Run the app.**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Features
- Product listings
- Shopping cart
- Checkout functionality
- Simple web interface
- Easy to extend for more features

## How It Works
- Handles HTTP requests
- Renders templates for pages
- Stores products and cart in database

## GUI Components
- **Home page:** Lists products
- **Cart page:** Shows selected items
- **Checkout page:** Handles payment

## Use Cases
- Simulate online shopping
- Learn web development
- Build portfolio projects

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding user authentication
- Supporting payment gateways
- Improving UI with CSS
- Adding product search/filter
- Deploying online

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def add_payment_gateway():
    # Integrate with Stripe or PayPal
    pass

def add_user_login():
    # Require login for checkout
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Flask errors:** Check installation
- **App not running:** Check port and debug mode
- **Database errors:** Check database setup

## Conclusion
This project teaches Flask basics, database usage, and web app structure. Extend it for more features and production use.

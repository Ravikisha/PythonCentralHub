## Abstract
Basic File Version Control System is a Python project that tracks changes to files and allows users to revert to previous versions. It demonstrates file management, hashing, and simple CLI interaction. This project is ideal for learning about versioning, backups, and automation in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- os, shutil, hashlib (built-in)
- datetime (built-in)

## Before you Start
Ensure Python is installed. No external packages are required.

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `file-version-control`.
2. Create a file named `basic_file_version_control_system.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/basic_file_version_control_system.py" lang="python" title="Basic File Version Control System" />
4. Run the script: `python basic_file_version_control_system.py`

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import modules**
```python
import os
import shutil
import hashlib
import datetime
```
2. **Save file versions**
```python
def save_version(file_path):
    # Save copy with timestamp
    pass
```
3. **List and restore versions**
```python
def list_versions():
    # Show available versions
    pass

def restore_version(version):
    # Restore selected version
    pass
```

## Features
- Tracks file changes
- Saves versions with timestamps
- Allows restoring previous versions
- Simple CLI usage

## How It Works
- Copies file to versioned folder on change
- Lists available versions
- Restores selected version

## Use Cases
- Backup important files
- Track document changes
- Learn version control basics

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding logging
- Supporting multiple files
- Adding a GUI
- Integrating with cloud storage
- Conflict resolution

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def add_logging():
    # Log all version actions
    pass

def cloud_backup():
    # Sync versions to cloud
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **File not saved:** Check file path
- **Restore not working:** Check version folder
- **Permission errors:** Check file access

## Conclusion
This project teaches file management, versioning, and automation. Extend it for more robust version control and features.

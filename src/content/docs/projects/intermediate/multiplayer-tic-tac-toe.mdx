## Abstract

Build a Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game using socket programming. Two players can play over a network with real-time updates of the game board. This project demonstrates network programming, concurrency, and game logic in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Familiarity with socket programming
- Knowledge of threading for concurrency

## Getting Started
### Creating a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `multiplayer_tic_tac_toe`.
2. Create a new file inside the folder and name it `multiplayer_tic_tac_toe.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into the `multiplayer_tic_tac_toe.py` file.

### Write the code
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/multiplayer_tic_tac_toe.py" lang="python" title="multiplayer_tic_tac_toe.py" showLineNumbers={1} />

## Key Features
- Two-player networked Tic-Tac-Toe
- Real-time game board updates
- Server-client architecture
- Threading for handling multiple players

## Explanation

### Server Implementation
The server manages connections and game state:
```python title="multiplayer_tic_tac_toe.py" showLineNumbers={1}
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind((HOST, PORT))
server.listen(2)
```

### Game Logic
The board is updated and checked for winners after each move:
```python title="multiplayer_tic_tac_toe.py" showLineNumbers={1}
def check_winner():
    winning_combinations = [ ... ]
    for combo in winning_combinations:
        if board[combo[0]] == board[combo[1]] == board[combo[2]] != " ":
            return board[combo[0]]
    if " " not in board:
        return "Draw"
    return None
```

### Client Handling
Each client is handled in a separate thread:
```python title="multiplayer_tic_tac_toe.py" showLineNumbers={1}
def handle_client(conn, addr):
    # Communicate with player, update board
```

## Running the Application
1. Save the file.
2. Run the server:
```bash
python multiplayer_tic_tac_toe.py
```
3. Run the client in a separate terminal:
```bash
python multiplayer_tic_tac_toe.py
```

## Conclusion
This Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe project is a great way to learn about networked games and concurrency in Python. You can extend it by adding a GUI, chat feature, or player statistics.

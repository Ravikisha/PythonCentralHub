## Abstract

Create an Anagram Game that challenges users to form words from a scrambled set of letters. The app generates random anagrams, validates user input, and keeps track of the score. This project demonstrates string manipulation, randomization, and GUI development in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Familiarity with Tkinter for GUI development
- Knowledge of string operations

## Getting Started
### Creating a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `anagram_game`.
2. Create a new file inside the folder and name it `anagram_game.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into the `anagram_game.py` file.

### Write the code
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/anagram_game.py" lang="python" title="anagram_game.py" showLineNumbers={1} />

## Key Features
- Generate random anagrams from a word list
- Validate user input against the original word
- Keep track of the score
- GUI interface for user interaction

## Explanation

### Generating Anagrams
The app randomly selects a word and scrambles its letters:
```python title="anagram_game.py" showLineNumbers={1}
self.current_word = random.choice(WORDS)
self.scrambled_word = "".join(random.sample(self.current_word, len(self.current_word)))
```

### Checking Answers
User input is validated against the original word, and the score is updated:
```python title="anagram_game.py" showLineNumbers={1}
if user_answer == self.current_word:
    self.score += 1
    messagebox.showinfo("Correct!", f"Well done! Your score: {self.score}")
else:
    messagebox.showerror("Incorrect", f"The correct word was: {self.current_word}")
```

## Running the Application
1. Save the file.
2. Run the application:
```bash
python anagram_game.py
```

## Conclusion
This Anagram Game project is a fun way to practice string manipulation and GUI development in Python. You can extend it by adding a larger word list, hints, or a timer feature.

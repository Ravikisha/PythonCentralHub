## Abstract

Create a dynamic portfolio website using Flask that showcases projects, skills, and experience with a professional responsive design. This project demonstrates web development with Flask, template rendering, form handling, and creating dynamic content management for personal branding.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Solid understanding of Python syntax and web development
- Knowledge of Flask framework and Jinja2 templating
- Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript
- Understanding of responsive web design principles
- Basic knowledge of form handling and data validation

## Getting Started

### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `portfolioWebsite`.
2. Create a new file and name it `portfoliowebsite.py`.
3. Create folders: `templates`, `static/css`, `static/js`, `static/images`
4. Install required dependencies: `pip install flask flask-wtf flask-sqlalchemy`
5. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
6. Copy the code below and paste it into your `portfoliowebsite.py` file.

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to your `portfoliowebsite.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/portfoliowebsite.py" lang="python" title="Dynamic Portfolio Website with Flask" />
2. Save the file.
3. Run the following command to start the website.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\portfolioWebsite> python portfoliowebsite.py
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Portfolio Website Server
========================
✓ Database initialized
✓ Templates loaded
✓ Static files ready
✓ Server running on http://localhost:5000
Visit your portfolio: http://localhost:5000
Admin panel: http://localhost:5000/admin
```

## Explanation

1. The `from flask import Flask, render_template, request` imports Flask components for web development.
2. The `flask_wtf` provides form handling and validation capabilities for contact forms.
3. The `PortfolioSite` class manages the website structure and content organization.
4. Template rendering displays dynamic content using Jinja2 templating engine.
5. Responsive design ensures the website works on all devices and screen sizes.
6. Project gallery showcases work samples with images, descriptions, and links.
7. Contact form enables visitors to send messages with validation and feedback.
8. Skills section displays technical competencies and experience levels.
9. About page provides personal information and professional background.
10. Navigation system creates smooth user experience across website sections.
11. Static file serving handles CSS, JavaScript, and image resources.
12. Database integration stores contact messages and portfolio data.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Dynamic Portfolio Website in Python. Experiment with the code and see if you can modify the application. Here are a few suggestions:
- Add blog functionality with post creation and management
- Implement user authentication for admin features
- Create dynamic theme switching capabilities
- Add social media integration and sharing

## Conclusion

In this project, you learned how to create a Dynamic Portfolio Website in Python using Flask. You also learned about web development, template rendering, responsive design, and creating professional online presence. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ravikisha/PythonCentralHub/blob/main/projects/intermediate/portfoliowebsite.py)

## Code Explanation

### Flask Application Structure
```python title="portfoliowebsite.py" showLineNumbers{1}
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, TextAreaField, SubmitField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired, Email

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'
```

Sets up the Flask application with form handling and security configuration.

### Template Rendering
```python title="portfoliowebsite.py" showLineNumbers{1}
@app.route('/')
def home():
    projects = get_featured_projects()
    skills = get_skills_data()
    return render_template('index.html', projects=projects, skills=skills)
```

Renders dynamic content by passing data from Python to HTML templates.

### Contact Form Handling
```python title="portfoliowebsite.py" showLineNumbers{1}
class ContactForm(FlaskForm):
    name = StringField('Name', validators=[DataRequired()])
    email = StringField('Email', validators=[DataRequired(), Email()])
    message = TextAreaField('Message', validators=[DataRequired()])
    submit = SubmitField('Send Message')

@app.route('/contact', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def contact():
    form = ContactForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        save_contact_message(form.data)
        return redirect(url_for('contact', success=True))
    return render_template('contact.html', form=form)
```

Implements form validation, data processing, and user feedback for contact functionality.

### Responsive Design Integration
```python title="portfoliowebsite.py" showLineNumbers{1}
@app.route('/projects')
def projects():
    project_list = get_all_projects()
    return render_template('projects.html', 
                         projects=project_list,
                         page_title='My Projects')
```

Creates project showcase with responsive grid layout and detailed project information.

## Abstract
This advanced web scraping application is designed for professional data extraction from various website types. Unlike basic scrapers, this tool includes sophisticated features like rate limiting, user agent rotation, content type detection, and robust error handling. It can scrape news articles, product information from e-commerce sites, and social media posts, then export the data in multiple formats.

## Features
- **Multi-site Support**: News, e-commerce, and social media platforms
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delays to avoid being blocked
- **User Agent Rotation**: Multiple browser identities for stealth scraping
- **Export Options**: CSV, JSON, and database storage
- **Content Detection**: Automatic identification of page content types
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Logging System**: Detailed operation logs for debugging
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time scraping progress monitoring

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or above
- BeautifulSoup4 library
- Requests library
- CSV and JSON modules (built-in)
- Time and logging modules (built-in)
- Text editor or IDE

## Installation
Before we start, install the required libraries:

```bash title="Install Dependencies"
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests lxml
```

## Getting Started
### Creating the Project
1. Create a folder named `advanced-web-scraper`
2. Create a file named `webscrapingbeautifulsoup.py`
3. Copy the code below into the file

### The Complete Code
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/webscrapingbeautifulsoup.py" lang="python" title="Advanced Web Scraper" />

## How It Works

### 1. WebScraper Class Architecture
```python
class WebScraper:
    def __init__(self, delay=1, max_retries=3):
        self.delay = delay
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.scraped_data = []
```

The main class manages:
- **Session Management**: Persistent connections for efficiency
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delays between requests
- **Data Storage**: In-memory storage before export
- **Error Tracking**: Retry mechanisms and failure logging

### 2. User Agent Rotation
```python
self.user_agents = [
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36'
]
```

Multiple user agents help avoid detection by:
- Simulating different browsers and operating systems
- Reducing the chance of being blocked
- Appearing as organic traffic

### 3. Content Type Detection
The scraper automatically detects website types:
- **News Sites**: Extracts headlines, authors, dates, content
- **E-commerce**: Gets product names, prices, descriptions, reviews
- **Social Media**: Collects posts, usernames, timestamps, engagement

### 4. Data Export Options
```python
def save_to_csv(self, filename):
    # Export to CSV format
    
def save_to_json(self, filename):
    # Export to JSON format
    
def save_to_database(self, db_name):
    # Save to SQLite database
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# Create scraper instance
scraper = WebScraper(delay=2, max_retries=3)

# Scrape a single page
url = "https://example-news-site.com"
scraper.scrape_page(url)

# Export data
scraper.save_to_csv("scraped_data.csv")
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# Scrape multiple URLs
urls = [
    "https://news-site.com/article1",
    "https://shop-site.com/products",
    "https://social-site.com/posts"
]

for url in urls:
    scraper.scrape_page(url)
    
# Save in multiple formats
scraper.save_to_json("data.json")
scraper.save_to_csv("data.csv")
```

### Run the Application
```bash
python webscrapingbeautifulsoup.py
```

## Sample Output

article,"Market Update","https://example.com/market","Stock market analysis...",,"Jane Smith","2025-09-02"
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Error Handling
```python
try:
    response = self.session.get(url, timeout=10)
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    self.logger.error(f"Error fetching {url}: {e}")
    return None
```

### 2. Content Validation
```python
def validate_content(self, soup, content_type):
    """Validate scraped content quality"""
    if content_type == "article":
        return len(soup.get_text()) > 100
    elif content_type == "product":
        return soup.find(class_="price") is not None
```

### 3. Rate Limiting
```python
def apply_rate_limit(self):
    """Apply configurable rate limiting"""
    time.sleep(self.delay)
    self.logger.info(f"Rate limiting: waited {self.delay} seconds")
```

## Configuration Options

### Scraper Settings
```python
# Basic configuration
scraper = WebScraper(
    delay=3,           # Seconds between requests
    max_retries=5,     # Max retry attempts
    timeout=15         # Request timeout
)

# Advanced configuration
scraper.configure(
    user_agent_rotation=True,
    content_validation=True,
    export_format="both"  # csv, json, or both
)
```

### Customizing for Specific Sites
```python
# Site-specific configurations
configs = {
    "news_sites": {
        "selectors": {
            "title": "h1.headline",
            "content": "div.article-body",
            "author": "span.author-name"
        }
    },
    "ecommerce_sites": {
        "selectors": {
            "title": "h1.product-title",
            "price": "span.price",
            "description": "div.description"
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Respect robots.txt
```python
def check_robots_txt(self, url):
    """Check if scraping is allowed"""
    robots_url = urljoin(url, '/robots.txt')
    # Implementation to parse robots.txt
```

### 2. Handle Dynamic Content
```python
def handle_javascript(self, url):
    """Handle JavaScript-rendered content"""
    # Use Selenium for dynamic content
    from selenium import webdriver
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get(url)
    html = driver.page_source
    return BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
```

### 3. Data Cleaning
```python
def clean_text(self, text):
    """Clean and normalize scraped text"""
    import re
    # Remove extra whitespace
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
    # Remove special characters
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s-.]', '', text)
    return text.strip()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Getting Blocked**
```python
# Solutions:
- Increase delay between requests
- Rotate user agents more frequently
- Use proxy rotation
- Implement session management
```

**2. Dynamic Content Not Loading**
```python
# Solutions:
- Use Selenium WebDriver
- Wait for JavaScript to load
- Look for API endpoints
- Check network requests in browser
```

**3. Data Quality Issues**
```python
# Solutions:
- Implement content validation
- Use multiple CSS selectors
- Add data cleaning functions
- Verify extracted data
```

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Important Guidelines
1. **Check robots.txt**: Always respect site policies
2. **Rate Limiting**: Don't overwhelm servers
3. **Terms of Service**: Read and comply with site terms
4. **Copyright**: Respect intellectual property rights
5. **Personal Data**: Handle personal information carefully

### Sample robots.txt Check
```python
def is_scraping_allowed(self, url, user_agent='*'):
    """Check if scraping is allowed by robots.txt"""
    from urllib.robotparser import RobotFileParser
    
    robots_url = urljoin(url, '/robots.txt')
    rp = RobotFileParser()
    rp.set_url(robots_url)
    rp.read()
    
    return rp.can_fetch(user_agent, url)
```

## Extensions and Improvements

### 1. Add Database Support
```python
import sqlite3

def save_to_database(self, db_name="scraped_data.db"):
    """Save data to SQLite database"""
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
    # Create tables and insert data
```

### 2. Add Proxy Support
```python
def setup_proxies(self):
    """Configure proxy rotation"""
    self.proxies = [
        {'http': 'http://proxy1:port'},
        {'http': 'http://proxy2:port'}
    ]
```

### 3. Add Monitoring Dashboard
```python
def create_dashboard(self):
    """Create real-time scraping dashboard"""
    # Use Flask or Streamlit for web interface
```

- Text Editor or IDE
- Solid understanding of Python syntax and web technologies
- Knowledge of HTML, CSS selectors, and DOM structure
- Familiarity with HTTP requests and web protocols
- Understanding of ethical web scraping principles
- Basic knowledge of data processing and export formats

## Getting Started

### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `advancedWebScraper`.
2. Create a new file and name it `webscrapingbeautifulsoup.py`.
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install beautifulsoup4 requests lxml`
4. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
5. Copy the code below and paste it into your `webscrapingbeautifulsoup.py` file.

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to your `webscrapingbeautifulsoup.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/webscrapingbeautifulsoup.py" lang="python" title="Advanced Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup" />
2. Save the file.
3. Run the following command to start the scraper.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}

Advanced Web Scraper
====================
1. Scrape News Articles
2. Scrape E-commerce Products
3. Scrape Social Media Posts
4. Custom URL Scraping
Choose scraping mode: 1
Target URL: https://example-news.com
✓ Found 25 articles
✓ Data exported to news_articles_20250903.csv
✓ Scraping completed in 45.2 seconds
```

## Explanation

1. The `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup` imports the BeautifulSoup library for HTML parsing and extraction.
2. The `import requests` provides HTTP functionality for making web requests to target sites.
3. The `WebScraper` class manages all scraping operations and configuration settings.
4. Rate limiting prevents overwhelming target servers and reduces the risk of being blocked.
5. User agent rotation makes requests appear to come from different browsers and devices.
6. The `parse_html()` method extracts specific data elements using CSS selectors.
7. Content type detection automatically identifies article titles, prices, or post content.
8. Error handling manages network issues, parsing errors, and missing elements gracefully.
9. Export functionality saves scraped data to CSV, JSON, or database formats.
10. Progress tracking provides real-time feedback during large scraping operations.
11. Logging system records all operations for debugging and monitoring purposes.
12. Retry mechanisms handle temporary failures and network interruptions automatically.

## Conclusion

In this project, you learned how to create an Advanced Web Scraper in Python using BeautifulSoup. You also learned about ethical web scraping, HTML parsing, data extraction techniques, and implementing professional scraping solutions. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ravikisha/PythonCentralHub/blob/main/projects/intermediate/webscrapingbeautifulsoup.py)

## How It Works

### 1. WebScraper Class Architecture
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
class WebScraper:
    def __init__(self, delay=1, max_retries=3):
        self.delay = delay
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.scraped_data = []
```

The main class manages:
- **Session Management**: Persistent connections for efficiency
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delays between requests
- **Data Storage**: In-memory storage before export
- **Error Tracking**: Retry mechanisms and failure logging

### 2. User Agent Rotation
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
self.user_agents = [
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36'
]
```

Multiple user agents help avoid detection by:
- Simulating different browsers and operating systems
- Reducing the chance of being blocked
- Appearing as organic traffic

### 3. Content Type Detection
The scraper automatically detects website types:
- **News Sites**: Extracts headlines, authors, dates, content
- **E-commerce**: Gets product names, prices, descriptions, reviews
- **Social Media**: Collects posts, usernames, timestamps, engagement

### 4. Data Export Options
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def save_to_csv(self, filename):
    # Export to CSV format
    
def save_to_json(self, filename):
    # Export to JSON format
    
def save_to_database(self, db_name):
    # Save to SQLite database
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
# Create scraper instance
scraper = WebScraper(delay=2, max_retries=3)

# Scrape a single page
url = "https://example-news-site.com"
scraper.scrape_page(url)

# Export data
scraper.save_to_csv("scraped_data.csv")
```

### Advanced Usage
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
# Scrape multiple URLs
urls = [
    "https://news-site.com/article1",
    "https://shop-site.com/products",
    "https://social-site.com/posts"
]

for url in urls:
    scraper.scrape_page(url)
    
# Save in multiple formats
scraper.save_to_json("data.json")
scraper.save_to_csv("data.csv")
```

### Run the Application
```bash
python webscrapingbeautifulsoup.py
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Error Handling
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
try:
    response = self.session.get(url, timeout=10)
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    self.logger.error(f"Error fetching {url}: {e}")
    return None
```

### 2. Content Validation
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def validate_content(self, soup, content_type):
    """Validate scraped content quality"""
    if content_type == "article":
        return len(soup.get_text()) > 100
    elif content_type == "product":
        return soup.find(class_="price") is not None
```

### 3. Rate Limiting
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def apply_rate_limit(self):
    """Apply configurable rate limiting"""
    time.sleep(self.delay)
    self.logger.info(f"Rate limiting: waited {self.delay} seconds")
```

## Configuration Options

### Scraper Settings
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
# Basic configuration
scraper = WebScraper(
    delay=3,           # Seconds between requests
    max_retries=5,     # Max retry attempts
    timeout=15         # Request timeout
)

# Advanced configuration
scraper.configure(
    user_agent_rotation=True,
    content_validation=True,
    export_format="both"  # csv, json, or both
)
```

### Customizing for Specific Sites
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
# Site-specific configurations
configs = {
    "news_sites": {
        "selectors": {

            "content": "div.article-body",
            "author": "span.author-name"
        }
    },
    "ecommerce_sites": {
        "selectors": {
            "title": "h1.product-title",
            "price": "span.price",
            "description": "div.description"
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Respect robots.txt
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def check_robots_txt(self, url):

    robots_url = urljoin(url, '/robots.txt')
    # Implementation to parse robots.txt
```

### 2. Handle Dynamic Content
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def handle_javascript(self, url):
    """Handle JavaScript-rendered content"""
    # Use Selenium for dynamic content
    from selenium import webdriver
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get(url)
    html = driver.page_source
    return BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
```

### 3. Data Cleaning
```python title="advancedwebscraper.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def clean_text(self, text):
    """Clean and normalize scraped text"""
    import re
    # Remove extra whitespace
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
    # Remove special characters
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s-.]', '', text)
    return text.strip()
```

## Abstract
Simple Blog with Flask is a Python web application that allows users to create, view, and manage blog posts. It demonstrates web development, routing, and template rendering with Flask. This project is ideal for learning about backend development, HTTP requests, and dynamic web pages.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Flask (`pip install flask`)

## Before you Start
Install Python and Flask. Familiarize yourself with basic web concepts.

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `simple-blog`.
2. Create a file named `simple_blog_with_flask.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/simple_blog_with_flask.py" lang="python" title="Simple Blog with Flask" />
4. Run the script: `python simple_blog_with_flask.py`

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import modules**
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect
```
2. **Set up Flask app**
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```
3. **Define routes**
```python
@app.route('/')
def home():
    # Show all posts
    pass

@app.route('/add', methods=['POST'])
def add_post():
    # Add new post
    pass
```
4. **Run the app**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Features
- Create and view blog posts
- Simple web interface
- Demonstrates Flask routing
- Easy to extend for more features

## How It Works
- Handles HTTP requests
- Renders templates for pages
- Stores posts in memory or file

## GUI Components
- **Home page:** Lists posts
- **Form:** For adding new posts
- **Buttons:** For navigation

## Use Cases
- Personal blogging
- Learning web development
- Building portfolio sites

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding user authentication
- Storing posts in a database
- Supporting comments
- Improving UI with CSS
- Deploying online

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def add_database_support():
    # Use SQLite or PostgreSQL
    pass

def add_user_login():
    # Require login for posting
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Flask errors:** Check installation
- **App not running:** Check port and debug mode
- **Posts not saving:** Check storage logic

## Conclusion
This project teaches Flask basics, routing, and web app structure. Extend it for more features and production use.

## Abstract

Build a Quiz Game with Timer that challenges users to answer multiple-choice questions within a time limit. The app tracks the score and provides instant feedback. This project demonstrates event-driven programming, threading, and GUI development in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Familiarity with Tkinter for GUI development
- Knowledge of threading for timers

## Getting Started
### Creating a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `quiz_game_with_timer`.
2. Create a new file inside the folder and name it `quiz_game_with_timer.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into the `quiz_game_with_timer.py` file.

### Write the code
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/quiz_game_with_timer.py" lang="python" title="quiz_game_with_timer.py" showLineNumbers={1} />

## Key Features
- Multiple-choice questions
- Timer for each question
- Score tracking and instant feedback
- GUI interface for user interaction

## Explanation

### Timer Implementation
The app uses threading to implement a countdown timer for each question:
```python title="quiz_game_with_timer.py" showLineNumbers={1}
self.time_left = 10
threading.Thread(target=self.start_timer).start()
```

### Checking Answers
User answers are checked and the score is updated:
```python title="quiz_game_with_timer.py" showLineNumbers={1}
if selected_option == question_data["answer"]:
    self.score += 1
```

### Displaying Questions
Questions and options are displayed using Tkinter widgets:
```python title="quiz_game_with_timer.py" showLineNumbers={1}
self.question_label.config(text=question_data["question"])
for i, option in enumerate(question_data["options"]):
    self.options[i].config(text=option)
```

## Running the Application
1. Save the file.
2. Run the application:
```bash
python quiz_game_with_timer.py
```

## Conclusion
This Quiz Game with Timer project is a fun way to learn about event-driven programming and threading in Python. You can extend it by adding more questions, difficulty levels, or a high score leaderboard.

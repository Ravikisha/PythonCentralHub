## Code Explanation

### Machine Learning Integration
```python title="aitaskmanager.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def train_ai_models(self):
    # Prepare text data
    df['full_text'] = df['task_title'].fillna('') + ' ' + df['task_description'].fillna('')
    
    # Vectorize text using TF-IDF
    X_text = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(df['full_text'])
    
    # Extract additional features
    additional_features = []
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        analysis = self.analyze_task_text(row['task_title'], row['task_description'])
        additional_features.append([
            analysis['sentiment_score'],
            analysis['urgency_score'],
            analysis['complexity_score']
        ])
    
    # Combine features and train model
    X = np.hstack([X_text.toarray(), X_additional])
    self.priority_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Implements comprehensive machine learning pipeline with feature extraction and model training.

### Natural Language Processing
```python title="aitaskmanager.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def analyze_task_text(self, title, description=""):
    full_text = f"{title} {description}".lower()
    
    # Sentiment analysis using VADER
    sentiment = self.sentiment_analyzer.polarity_scores(full_text)
    sentiment_score = sentiment['compound']
    
    # Urgency keyword detection
    urgency_keywords = ['urgent', 'asap', 'critical', 'emergency', 'deadline']
    urgency_score = sum(1 for keyword in urgency_keywords if keyword in full_text)
    
    # Complexity analysis
    complexity_keywords = ['complex', 'research', 'analysis', 'design', 'architecture']
    complexity_score = sum(1 for keyword in complexity_keywords if keyword in full_text)
    
    return {
        'sentiment_score': sentiment_score,
        'urgency_score': urgency_score,
        'complexity_score': complexity_score
    }
```

Analyzes task text using advanced NLP techniques for sentiment and complexity detection.

### AI Priority Prediction
```python title="aitaskmanager.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def predict_task_priority(self, title, description=""):
    # Analyze text features
    analysis = self.analyze_task_text(title, description)
    full_text = f"{title} {description}"
    
    # Vectorize text
    text_features = self.vectorizer.transform([full_text])
    
    # Create feature vector
    additional_features = np.array([[
        analysis['sentiment_score'],
        analysis['urgency_score'],
        analysis['complexity_score']
    ]])
    
    # Combine features and predict
    combined_features = np.hstack([text_features.toarray(), additional_features])
    predicted_priority = self.priority_model.predict(combined_features)[0]
    probability = self.priority_model.predict_proba(combined_features)[0]
    
    return {
        'priority': int(predicted_priority),
        'confidence': float(max(probability))
    }
```

Uses trained ML model to intelligently predict task priorities with confidence scores.

### Real-Time Web Interface
```python title="aitaskmanager.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def setup_socket_events(self):
    @self.socketio.on('connect')
    def handle_connect():
        if 'user_id' in session:
            join_room(f"user_{session['user_id']}")
            emit('connected', {'message': 'Connected to real-time updates'})
    
    @self.socketio.on('task_update')
    def handle_task_update(data):
        if 'user_id' in session:
            self.socketio.emit('task_updated', data, room=f"user_{session['user_id']}")
```

Implements real-time collaboration using WebSockets for instant updates across clients.

### Smart Recommendations Engine
```python title="aitaskmanager.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def get_smart_suggestions(self, user_id):
    suggestions = {
        'overdue_tasks': [],
        'high_priority_due_soon': [],
        'workload_insights': {},
        'productivity_tips': []
    }
    
    # Analyze overdue tasks
    for _, task in df.iterrows():
        if task['due_date'] and task['status'] != 'done':
            due_date = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(task['due_date'])
            if due_date < now:
                suggestions['overdue_tasks'].append({
                    'id': task['id'],
                    'title': task['title'],
                    'days_overdue': (now - due_date).days
                })
    
    # Generate productivity insights
    if len(suggestions['overdue_tasks']) > 3:
        suggestions['productivity_tips'].append(
            "Consider setting more realistic deadlines"
        )
```

Provides AI-powered insights and recommendations based on user behavior analysis.

### Secure Authentication System
```python title="aitaskmanager.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def create_user(self, username, email, password, full_name=""):
    # Check if user already exists
    cursor.execute("SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = ? OR email = ?", (username, email))
    if cursor.fetchone():
        return None, "User already exists"
    
    # Hash password using bcrypt
    password_hash = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt()).decode('utf-8')
    
    cursor.execute('''
        INSERT INTO users (username, email, password_hash, full_name)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
    ''', (username, email, password_hash, full_name))
```

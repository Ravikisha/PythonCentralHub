## Abstract
Weather App with Voice Commands is a Python project that fetches weather data and allows users to interact using voice commands. It demonstrates API integration, speech recognition, and GUI development. This project is ideal for learning about voice interfaces, REST APIs, and real-world automation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- requests (`pip install requests`)
- speech_recognition (`pip install SpeechRecognition`)
- tkinter (usually pre-installed)

## Before you Start
Install Python, requests, and SpeechRecognition. Obtain a free API key from a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `weather-voice-app`.
2. Create a file named `weather_app_with_voice_commands.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/weather_app_with_voice_commands.py" lang="python" title="Weather App with Voice Commands" />
4. Run the script: `python weather_app_with_voice_commands.py`

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import modules**
```python
import requests
import speech_recognition as sr
import tkinter as tk
```
2. **Fetch weather and process voice**
```python
def get_weather(city):
    # Fetch weather data from API
    pass

def listen_for_command():
    # Use microphone to get user input
    pass
```
3. **GUI for weather display**
```python
root = tk.Tk()
root.title('Weather App with Voice Commands')
# ...setup widgets for weather info and voice input...
root.mainloop()
```

## Features
- Fetches weather data from API
- Accepts voice commands
- GUI for display
- Easy to extend for more features

## How It Works
- Listens for voice input
- Fetches weather for requested city
- Displays info in GUI

## GUI Components
- **Label:** Shows weather info
- **Button:** Starts voice recognition
- **Entry box:** For manual city input

## Use Cases
- Hands-free weather updates
- Learn API and voice integration
- Build smart home apps

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding more voice commands
- Supporting multiple languages
- Improving GUI design
- Integrating with other smart devices

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def add_language_support():
    # Recognize commands in other languages
    pass

def integrate_with_smart_home():
    # Control devices based on weather
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **API key errors:** Check your key
- **Voice not recognized:** Check microphone
- **GUI not showing:** Ensure Tkinter is installed

## Conclusion
This project teaches API usage, speech recognition, and GUI basics. Extend it for more features and smart automation.

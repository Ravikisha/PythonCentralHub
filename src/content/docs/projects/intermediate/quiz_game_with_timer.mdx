## Abstract
Quiz Game with Timer is a Python project that challenges users with timed questions. It demonstrates event-driven programming, GUI development, and time management. This project is ideal for learning about interactive games, user input, and countdown timers in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- tkinter (usually pre-installed)
- random (built-in)

## Before you Start
Ensure Python is installed. No external packages are required. For GUI, make sure Tkinter is available.

## Getting Started
1. Create a folder named `quiz-game-timer`.
2. Create a file named `quiz_game_with_timer.py`.
3. Copy the code below into your file.
<FileCode file="projects/intermediate/quiz_game_with_timer.py" lang="python" title="Quiz Game with Timer" />
4. Run the script: `python quiz_game_with_timer.py`

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import modules**
```python
import tkinter as tk
import random
```
2. **Set up questions and timer**
```python
questions = [
    {'q': 'What is 2+2?', 'a': '4'},
    {'q': 'Capital of France?', 'a': 'Paris'}
]
```
3. **Timer mechanism**
```python
def start_timer():
    # Countdown logic
    pass
```
4. **GUI for quiz**
```python
root = tk.Tk()
root.title('Quiz Game with Timer')
# ...setup widgets for questions, input, timer...
root.mainloop()
```

## Features
- Timed questions
- Score tracking
- Randomized questions
- GUI for interaction

## How It Works
- Displays questions one by one
- Starts timer for each question
- User enters answer before time runs out
- Updates score and moves to next question

## GUI Components
- **Label:** Shows question
- **Entry box:** For answer
- **Timer display:** Shows remaining time
- **Score display:** Tracks correct answers

## Use Cases
- Practice quick thinking
- Educational quizzes
- Game nights

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding more questions
- Implementing difficulty levels
- Adding sound alerts
- Keeping high scores
- Supporting multiplayer

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def add_sound_alert():
    # Play sound when time is up
    pass

def multiplayer_mode():
    # Allow multiple players
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Timer not working:** Check countdown logic
- **GUI not showing:** Ensure Tkinter is installed
- **Questions not loading:** Check question list

## Conclusion
This project teaches event-driven programming, timers, and GUI basics. Extend it for more features and challenge levels.

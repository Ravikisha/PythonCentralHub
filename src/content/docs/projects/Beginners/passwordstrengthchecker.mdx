## Abstract
Password Strength Checker is a Python application that evaluates the strength of passwords based on various security criteria. The application checks for minimum length requirements, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides immediate feedback to users about password weaknesses and suggestions for improvement. This project demonstrates the use of regular expressions, string analysis, and security best practices in Python programming.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- A code editor or IDE

## Before you Start
Before starting this project, you must have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You must have a code editor or IDE installed on your computer. If you don't have any code editor or IDE installed, you can download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Note: This project uses only built-in Python modules (`re` for regular expressions), so no additional installations are required.

## Getting Started
#### Create a Project
1. Create a folder named `password-strength-checker`.
2. Open the folder in your favorite code editor or IDE.
3. Create a file named `passwordstrengthchecker.py`.
4. Copy the given code and paste it in your `passwordstrengthchecker.py` file.

## Write the Code
1. Copy and paste the following code in your `passwordstrengthchecker.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/passwordstrengthchecker.py" lang="python" title="Password Strength Checker" />
2. Save the file.
3. Open the terminal in your code editor or IDE and navigate to the folder `password-strength-checker`.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1-20}
C:\Users\Your Name\password-strength-checker> python passwordstrengthchecker.py
Password must contain at least one special character.
Password must be at least 8 characters long.
Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
Password must contain at least one number.
Password must contain at least one special character.
Password is strong.
Password is strong.
```

## Explanation
1. Import the required module.
```python title="passwordstrengthchecker.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
import re
```

2. Define the password strength checking function.
```python title="passwordstrengthchecker.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
def password_strength_checker(password):
```

3. Check minimum length requirement.
```python title="passwordstrengthchecker.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
if len(password) < 8:
    print("Password must be at least 8 characters long.")
```

4. Check for lowercase letters using regular expressions.
```python title="passwordstrengthchecker.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
elif not re.search("[a-z]", password):
    print("Password must contain at least one lowercase letter.")
```

5. Check for uppercase letters.
```python title="passwordstrengthchecker.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
elif not re.search("[A-Z]", password):
    print("Password must contain at least one uppercase letter.")
```

6. Check for numbers.
```python title="passwordstrengthchecker.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
elif not re.search("[0-9]", password):
    print("Password must contain at least one number.")
```

7. Check for special characters.
```python title="passwordstrengthchecker.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
elif not re.search("[_@$]", password):
    print("Password must contain at least one special character.")
```

8. Confirm strong password.
```python title="passwordstrengthchecker.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
else:
    print("Password is strong.")
```

9. Test the function with various passwords.
```python title="passwordstrengthchecker.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-7}
password_strength_checker("Password123")
password_strength_checker("Password")
password_strength_checker("password123")
password_strength_checker("PASSWORD123")
password_strength_checker("Password@")
password_strength_checker("Password123@")
password_strength_checker("Password123@!")
```

## Security Criteria Checked
The application evaluates passwords based on these criteria:

### 1. **Length Requirement**
- Minimum 8 characters
- Longer passwords provide better security

### 2. **Lowercase Letters**
- Must contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- Increases character set complexity

### 3. **Uppercase Letters**
- Must contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- Adds to password entropy

### 4. **Numbers**
- Must contain at least one digit (0-9)
- Numerical characters increase complexity

### 5. **Special Characters**
- Must contain at least one special character (_, @, $)
- Note: Current implementation checks for limited special characters

## Features
- **Comprehensive Checking:** Evaluates multiple security criteria
- **Immediate Feedback:** Provides specific weakness identification
- **Regular Expression Power:** Uses regex for pattern matching
- **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use function-based approach
- **Batch Testing:** Can test multiple passwords at once
- **Clear Messages:** Specific feedback for each security requirement

## Regular Expression Patterns
The application uses these regex patterns:

- **`[a-z]`:** Matches any lowercase letter
- **`[A-Z]`:** Matches any uppercase letter
- **`[0-9]`:** Matches any digit
- **`[_@$]`:** Matches specific special characters

## Sample Test Results
```
Password123     → Missing special character
Password        → Too short, missing numbers and special characters
password123     → Missing uppercase and special characters
PASSWORD123     → Missing lowercase and special characters
Password@       → Missing numbers
Password123@    → Strong password ✓
Password123@!   → Strong password ✓
```

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding a GUI interface using Tkinter
- Implementing a scoring system (weak, medium, strong)
- Expanding special character requirements
- Adding checks for common passwords
- Implementing password generation suggestions
- Adding dictionary word detection
- Creating visual strength indicators
- Adding entropy calculation
- Implementing sequential character detection
- Adding customizable security requirements

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python
def enhanced_password_checker(password):
    score = 0
    feedback = []
    
    # Length scoring
    if len(password) >= 12:
        score += 2
    elif len(password) >= 8:
        score += 1
    else:
        feedback.append("Password too short")
    
    # Character type scoring
    if re.search("[a-z]", password):
        score += 1
    if re.search("[A-Z]", password):
        score += 1
    if re.search("[0-9]", password):
        score += 1
    if re.search("[!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\[\]{};':\"\\|,.<>\/?]", password):
        score += 2
    
    # Return strength level
    if score >= 7:
        return "Very Strong"
    elif score >= 5:
        return "Strong"
    elif score >= 3:
        return "Medium"
    else:
        return "Weak"
```

## Common Password Weaknesses
- **Too short:** Less than 8 characters
- **Single case:** Only uppercase or lowercase
- **No numbers:** Missing numerical characters
- **No symbols:** Missing special characters
- **Dictionary words:** Common words that can be found in dictionaries
- **Personal info:** Names, birthdays, addresses
- **Sequential patterns:** 123456, abcdef, qwerty

## Security Best Practices
- **Use unique passwords:** Different password for each account
- **Enable 2FA:** Two-factor authentication when available
- **Regular updates:** Change passwords periodically
- **Use password managers:** Store complex passwords securely
- **Avoid personal info:** Don't use easily guessable information

## Educational Value
This project teaches:
- **Regular expressions:** Pattern matching in strings
- **Conditional logic:** Multiple if-elif-else statements
- **String analysis:** Character type identification
- **Security concepts:** Password strength principles
- **Function design:** Modular code organization

## Conclusion
In this project, we learned how to create a Password Strength Checker using Python's regular expression module. We explored pattern matching techniques, security criteria evaluation, and user feedback systems. This project provides valuable insights into cybersecurity practices and demonstrates practical applications of string analysis in Python. The concepts learned here can be extended to more advanced security applications and validation systems. To find more projects like this, you can visit Python Central Hub.

from tkinter import messagebox
import re
```

2. **Define the email sending function with validation.**
```python title="emailsender.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-10}
def sendEmail():
    try:
        sender = email.get()
        rec = receiver.get()
        pas = password.get()
        msg = message.get()
        
        # Validating the Email
        if(sender == "Enter Your Email" or rec == "Enter Receiver's Email" or pas == "Enter Your Password" or msg == "Enter Your Message"):
            messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please Enter All The Fields")
            return
```

3. **Email validation using regular expressions.**
```python title="emailsender.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-8}
        # Validate Email Using Regular Expression
        email_regex = re.compile(r"[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+")
        if not email_regex.match(sender):
            messagebox.showerror("Error", "Invalid Email")
            return
        
        if not email_regex.match(rec):
            messagebox.showerror("Error", "Invalid Receiver's Email")
            return
```

4. **SMTP connection and email sending.**
```python title="emailsender.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-6}
        server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
        server.starttls()
        server.login(sender, pas)
        server.sendmail(sender, rec, msg)
        server.quit()
        messagebox.showinfo("Success", "Email Sent Successfully")
```

5. **GUI setup and layout.**
```python title="emailsender.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-15}
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Email Sender")
root.geometry("700x700")
root.config(background="white")

label_file_explorer = Label(root, text = "Email Sender using Tkinter", width = 100, height = 3, fg = "gray", bg = "whitesmoke")

email = Entry(root, width = 50)
email.insert(0, "Enter Your Email")
receiver = Entry(root, width = 50)
receiver.insert(0, "Enter Receiver's Email")
password = Entry(root, width = 50)
password.insert(0, "Enter Your Password")
message = Entry(root, width = 50)
message.insert(0, "Enter Your Message")
```

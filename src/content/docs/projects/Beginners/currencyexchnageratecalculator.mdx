## Abstract

Create a professional currency exchange rate calculator with a graphical interface that fetches real-time exchange rates from an API and converts between multiple currencies. This project demonstrates GUI development, API integration, and financial data processing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Knowledge of Tkinter for GUI development
- Familiarity with HTTP requests and APIs
- Understanding of JSON data processing

## Getting Started

### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `currencyExchangeCalculator`.
2. Create a new file and name it `currencyexchnageratecalculator.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into your `currencyexchnageratecalculator.py` file.

### Install required dependencies
1. Install requests library for API calls:
```bash
pip install requests
```

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to your `currencyexchnageratecalculator.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/currencyexchnageratecalculator.py" lang="python" title="Currency Exchange Rate Calculator GUI" />
2. Save the file.
3. Run the following command to run the application.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\currencyExchangeCalculator> python currencyexchnageratecalculator.py
[Currency Exchange Calculator GUI Opens]
- Enter amount to convert
- Select base currency from dropdown
- Select target currency from dropdown
- Click "Convert" to get real-time exchange rate
- Result displayed in popup message
Example: 100 USD to EUR = 85.23 EUR
```

3. **Use the Application**
   - Enter the amount to convert
   - Select source currency from dropdown
   - Select target currency from dropdown
   - Click "Convert" to get real-time exchange rate

```

## Explanation

1. The `import tkinter as tk` statement imports the Tkinter library for creating the GUI.
2. The `import requests` statement imports the requests library for making API calls.
3. The `win = Tk()` creates the main window for the application.
4. The `win.geometry("700x400")` sets the window size to 700x400 pixels.
5. The `def exchange():` function handles the currency conversion logic.
6. The `requests.get()` function fetches real-time exchange rates from the API.
7. The `response.json()` parses the JSON response from the API.
8. The `rates[converted_currency]` extracts the specific exchange rate.
9. The `messagebox.showinfo()` displays the conversion result in a popup.
10. The `ttk.Combobox()` creates dropdown menus for currency selection.
11. The `Button()` widget creates the convert button with the exchange function.
12. The currency list includes major world currencies for conversion.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Currency Exchange Rate Calculator GUI in Python. Experiment with the code and see if you can modify the application. Here are a few suggestions:
- Add more currencies to the selection list
- Implement historical exchange rate charts
- Add currency conversion history tracking
- Create offline mode with cached rates
- Implement currency rate alerts and notifications
- Add calculator-style number input
- Create currency trend analysis features
- Add favorite currency pairs
- Implement rate comparison between different providers

## Conclusion

In this project, you learned how to create a Currency Exchange Rate Calculator GUI in Python using Tkinter and API integration. You also learned about working with real-time data, JSON processing, and creating professional GUI applications.

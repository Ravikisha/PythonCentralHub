## Abstract
ASCII Art Generator is a fun Python program that converts text into ASCII art using various fonts and colors. The program uses the `pyfiglet` library to generate ASCII text art and `termcolor` to add colors. Users can choose from multiple font styles, customize colors, and save their ASCII art to a file. This is a great project for beginners to learn about external libraries and file handling in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- A code editor or IDE
- pyfiglet module
- termcolor module
- colorama module

## Before you Start
Before starting this project, you must have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You must have a code editor or IDE installed on your computer. If you don't have any code editor or IDE installed, you can download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). You must have the required modules installed on your computer. If you don't have these modules installed, you can install them by using the following commands in your terminal.

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
C:\Users\Your Name>pip install pyfiglet
C:\Users\Your Name>pip install termcolor
C:\Users\Your Name>pip install colorama
```

## Getting Started
#### Create a Project
1. Create a folder named `ascii-art-generator`.
2. Open the folder in your favorite code editor or IDE.
3. Create a file named `asciiartgenerator.py`.
4. Copy the given code and paste it in your `asciiartgenerator.py` file.

## Write the Code
1. Copy and paste the following code in your `asciiartgenerator.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/asciiartgenerator.py" lang="python" title="ASCII Art Generator" />
2. Save the file.
3. Open the terminal in your code editor or IDE and navigate to the folder `ascii-art-generator`.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1-20}
C:\Users\Your Name\ascii-art-generator> python asciiartgenerator.py
ASCII Art Generator
Enter the text to convert to ASCII Art: 
Hello
Enter the color of the text: 
red
Enter the font style: 
big

 _   _          _   _       
| | | |   ___  | | | |  ___ 
| |_| |  / _ \ | | | | / _ \
|  _  | |  __/ | | | || (_) |
|_| |_|  \___| |_| |_| \___/ 

Do you want to save the ASCII Art? (y/n)
y
Enter the name of the file: 
hello.txt
File saved successfully!
Do you want to clear the screen? (y/n)
n
Thank you for using ASCII Art Generator!
```

## Explanation
1. Import the required modules.
```python title="asciiartgenerator.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-5}
import pyfiglet # pip install pyfiglet
import termcolor # pip install termcolor
import colorama
import os
```

2. Create the main function that handles ASCII art generation.
```python title="asciiartgenerator.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-10}
def asciiartgenerator():
    print("ASCII Art Generator")
    print("Enter the text to convert to ASCII Art: ")
    text = input()
    print("Enter the color of the text: ")
    color = input()
```

3. Display available font styles for the user to choose from.
```python title="asciiartgenerator.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-50}
print('''
3-d	
3x5	
5lineoblique
acrobatic
alligator
# ... more font options
''')
```

4. Generate ASCII art with the selected font and color.
```python title="asciiartgenerator.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-5}
font = input()
asciiart = pyfiglet.figlet_format(text, font=font)
colored_asciiart = termcolor.colored(asciiart, color=color)
print(colored_asciiart)
```

5. Optional file saving functionality.
```python title="asciiartgenerator.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-10}
print("Do you want to save the ASCII Art? (y/n)")
save = input()
if save == 'y':
    print("Enter the name of the file: ")
    filename = input()
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(colored_asciiart)
    print("File saved successfully!")
```

## Features
- Convert text to ASCII art using various fonts
- Add colors to your ASCII art
- Choose from 50+ different font styles
- Save ASCII art to a file
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Option to clear screen after generation

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding a GUI interface using Tkinter
- Creating a web version using Flask
- Adding more color options and effects
- Implementing font preview functionality
- Adding support for multi-line text input
- Creating preset font and color combinations

## Conclusion
In this project, we learned how to create an ASCII Art Generator using Python. We used external libraries like `pyfiglet` for text-to-ASCII conversion and `termcolor` for adding colors. This project demonstrates file handling, user input processing, and working with external libraries. To find more projects like this, you can visit Python Central Hub.

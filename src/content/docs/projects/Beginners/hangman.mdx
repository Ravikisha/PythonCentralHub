## Abstract
Hangman is a classic word guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This Python implementation uses a text file containing a list of words and randomly selects one for the player to guess. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses and tracks the number of remaining attempts. This project is excellent for beginners to learn about file handling, string manipulation, and game logic in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- A code editor or IDE
- A text file with words (words.txt)

## Before you Start
Before starting this project, you must have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You must have a code editor or IDE installed on your computer. If you don't have any code editor or IDE installed, you can download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Getting Started
#### Create a Project
1. Create a folder named `hangman-game`.
2. Open the folder in your favorite code editor or IDE.
3. Create a file named `hangman.py`.
4. Create a file named `words.txt` and add some words (one word per line).
5. Copy the given code and paste it in your `hangman.py` file.

#### Create Words File
Create a `words.txt` file in the same directory and add words like:
```txt title="words.txt" showLineNumbers{1} {1-10}
python
programming
computer
science
technology
development
software
coding
algorithm
function
```

## Write the Code
1. Copy and paste the following code in your `hangman.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/hangman.py" lang="python" title="Hangman Game" />
2. Save the file.
3. Make sure you have the `words.txt` file in the same directory.
4. Open the terminal in your code editor or IDE and navigate to the folder `hangman-game`.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1-30}
C:\Users\Your Name\hangman-game> python hangman.py
What is your name? John
Good Luck !  John
The game is about to start !

```

## Explanation
1. Import the required modules.
```python title="hangman.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
import random
import time
```

2. Get the player's name and provide welcome messages.
```python title="hangman.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-10}
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Good Luck ! ", name)

time.sleep(1)

print("The game is about to start !")
print("Let's play Hangman")

time.sleep(1)
```

3. Read words from the file and select a random word.
```python title="hangman.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-5}
open_file = open("words.txt", "r")
words = open_file.readlines()
word = random.choice(words)
word = word.lower().strip().replace("\n", "").replace("\r", "").replace(" ", "").replace("-", "")
```

4. Initialize game variables.
```python title="hangman.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
print("Guess the characters")
guesses = ''
turns = len(word) * 2
```

5. Main game loop - check guesses and display progress.
```python title="hangman.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-20}
while turns > 0:
    failed = 0
    for char in word:
        if char in guesses:
            print(char, end="")
        else:
            print("_", end="")
            failed += 1
    
    if failed == 0:
        print("\nYou Win")
        print("The word is: ", word)
        break
```

6. Handle user input and game logic.
```python title="hangman.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-15}
guess = input("guess a character: ")
guesses += guess

if guess not in word:
    turns -= 1
    print("Wrong")
    
    if turns == 0:
        print("\nYou Loose")
        print("\nThe word is: ", word)
        break
```

## Features
- Random word selection from a text file
- Limited number of guesses based on word length
- Real-time progress display with underscores
- Win/lose conditions with appropriate messages
- Input validation and feedback
- Clean and intuitive user interface

## How to Play
1. Run the program and enter your name
2. The game will display underscores representing each letter of the hidden word
3. Guess letters one at a time
4. Correct guesses reveal the letter's position(s) in the word
5. Incorrect guesses reduce your remaining attempts
6. Win by guessing all letters before running out of attempts
7. Lose if you exhaust all attempts without completing the word

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding a graphical hangman drawing for wrong guesses
- Implementing difficulty levels with different word categories
- Adding a scoring system based on guesses used
- Creating a GUI version using Tkinter
- Adding hint functionality
- Implementing multiplayer mode
- Adding word definitions or categories

## Conclusion
In this project, we learned how to create a Hangman game using Python. We covered file handling to read words from a text file, string manipulation for processing the selected word, and game logic for tracking guesses and determining win/lose conditions. This project demonstrates essential programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input handling. To find more projects like this, you can visit Python Central Hub.

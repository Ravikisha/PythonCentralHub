## Abstract

Build an engaging text-based adventure game featuring a fantasy story, player choices, inventory management, and multiple endings. This project demonstrates game logic, story branching, state management, and interactive narrative design using only text output and user input.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Knowledge of functions and control structures
- Familiarity with lists and string manipulation
- Understanding of game logic and state management

## Getting Started

### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `textBasedAdventureGame`.
2. Create a new file and name it `textbasedadventuregame.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into your `textbasedadventuregame.py` file.

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to your `textbasedadventuregame.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/textbasedadventuregame.py" lang="python" title="Text-Based Adventure Game" />
2. Save the file.
3. Run the following command to run the application.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\textBasedAdventureGame> python textbasedadventuregame.py
You find yourself standing in front of a cave.
In your hand you hold your trusty (but not very effective) dagger.

Enter 1 to knock on the door of the house.
Enter 2 to peer into the cave.
Please enter 1 or 2.
2

You have found the magical Sword of Ogoroth!
You are victorious!

Would you like to play again? (y/n)
```

3. **Play the Game**
   - Read the story text carefully
   - Make choices by entering numbers (1 or 2)
   ```

## Explanation

1. The `import time` statement imports the time module for adding pauses between story elements.
2. The `def print_pause()` function adds dramatic delays to create better story pacing.
3. The `def intro():` function sets up the initial game world and story context.
4. The `items = []` list tracks the player's inventory throughout the game.
5. The `def cave(items):` function handles the cave exploration and item discovery.
6. The `def house(items):` function manages the house encounter and combat.
7. The story branches based on whether the player has found the sword.
8. The `valid_inputs` list ensures players can only enter valid choices.
9. The `while True:` loops handle input validation and choice repetition.
10. The `def play_again():` function allows players to restart the adventure.
11. The game demonstrates consequence-based gameplay with different outcomes.
12. Multiple endings depend on player preparation and choices made.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Text-Based Adventure Game in Python. Experiment with the code and see if you can modify the application. Here are a few suggestions:
- Add more locations and story branches
- Implement character stats (health, strength, magic)
- Create more complex inventory with multiple items
- Add random events and encounters
- Implement save/load game functionality
- Create multiple characters to choose from
- Add puzzle-solving elements
- Implement dialogue trees with NPCs
- Create a larger world map with navigation

## Conclusion

In this project, you learned how to create a Text-Based Adventure Game in Python. You also learned about story branching, state management, inventory systems, and creating interactive narratives. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ravikisha/PythonCentralHub/blob/main/projects/beginners/textbasedadventuregame.py)


## Code Explanation

### Story Pacing and Immersion
```python title="textbasedadventuregame.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def print_pause(message_to_print):
    print(message_to_print)
    time.sleep(2)
```

Adds dramatic pauses between story elements to create better pacing and immersion in the narrative.

### Game Introduction
```python title="textbasedadventuregame.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def intro():
    print_pause("You find yourself standing in an open field, filled with grass and yellow wildflowers.")
    print_pause("Rumor has it that a wicked fairie is somewhere around here...")
    print_pause("In your hand you hold your trusty (but not very effective) dagger.")
```

Sets up the game world, story context, and initial player state with atmospheric descriptions.

### Inventory System
```python title="textbasedadventuregame.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def cave(items):
    if "Sword of Ogoroth" in items:
        print_pause("You've been here before, and gotten all the good stuff.")
    else:
        print_pause("You have found the magical Sword of Ogoroth!")
        items.append("Sword of Ogoroth")
```

Implements item collection and inventory tracking that affects story outcomes and player capabilities.

### Branching Combat System
```python title="textbasedadventuregame.py" showLineNumbers{1}
if "Sword of Ogoroth" in items:
    print_pause("The Sword of Ogoroth shines brightly in your hand...")
    print_pause("You have rid the town of the wicked fairie. You are victorious!")
else:
    print_pause("Your dagger is no match for the wicked fairie.")
    print_pause("You have been defeated!")
```

Creates different story outcomes based on player preparation and choices, demonstrating consequence-based gameplay.

### Choice Validation and Loops
```python title="textbasedadventuregame.py" showLineNumbers{1}
while True:
    choice = input("Would you like to (1) fight or (2) run away?")
    if choice == "1":
        # Handle fight choice
        break
    if choice == "2":
        # Handle run choice
        break
```

Ensures valid input from players and provides clear choice options with proper loop handling.

### Replay System
```python title="textbasedadventuregame.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def play_again():
    while True:
        choice = input("Would you like to play again? (y/n)")
        if choice == "y":
            play_game()
            break
        elif choice == "n":
            print_pause("Thanks for playing! See you next time.")
            break
```

Allows players to restart the adventure without relaunching the program.

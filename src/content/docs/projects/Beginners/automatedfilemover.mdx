## Abstract
Automated File Mover is a Python script that helps organize files by automatically moving them from a source directory to a destination directory based on their file extensions. The script targets specific file types (text, PDF, and image files) and provides feedback on each file moved. This project demonstrates file system operations, directory manipulation, and automated organization tasks. It's an excellent tool for maintaining clean directories and automating repetitive file management tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- A code editor or IDE
- Read/write permissions for target directories

## Before you Start
Before starting this project, you must have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You must have a code editor or IDE installed on your computer. If you don't have any code editor or IDE installed, you can download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

**Note:** This project uses only built-in Python modules (`os` and `shutil`), so no additional installations are required.

### Directory Setup
Before running the script, create the following directory structure:
```
project-folder/
├── automatedfilemover.py
├── source/          (create this folder and add test files)
└── destination/     (create this folder - files will be moved here)
```

## Getting Started
#### Create a Project
1. Create a folder named `automated-file-mover`.
2. Open the folder in your favorite code editor or IDE.
3. Create a file named `automatedfilemover.py`.
4. Create two subfolders: `source` and `destination`.
5. Add some test files to the `source` folder (e.g., test.txt, image.png, document.pdf).
6. Copy the given code and paste it in your `automatedfilemover.py` file.

## Write the Code
1. Copy and paste the following code in your `automatedfilemover.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/automatedfilemover.py" lang="python" title="Automated File Mover" />
2. Save the file.
3. Open the terminal in your code editor or IDE and navigate to the folder `automated-file-mover`.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1-10}
C:\Users\Your Name\automated-file-mover> python automatedfilemover.py
Moved document.txt to C:\Users\Your Name\automated-file-mover\destination\document.txt
Moved report.pdf to C:\Users\Your Name\automated-file-mover\destination\report.pdf
Moved photo.png to C:\Users\Your Name\automated-file-mover\destination\photo.png
Moved image.jpg to C:\Users\Your Name\automated-file-mover\destination\image.jpg
Move Complete

# All files with supported extensions are moved from source/ to destination/
```

## Explanation

### Code Breakdown
1. **Import required modules for file operations.**
```python title="automatedfilemover.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
import os
import shutil
```

2. **Set up source and destination directory paths.**
```python title="automatedfilemover.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
source = os.getcwd() + "/source/"
destination = os.getcwd() + "/destination/"
```

3. **Get list of files in the source directory.**
```python title="automatedfilemover.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
files = os.listdir(source)
```

4. **Define target file types for organization.**
```python title="automatedfilemover.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
file_types = ["txt", "pdf", "png", "jpg", "jpeg"]
```

5. **Move files based on their extensions.**
```python title="automatedfilemover.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-6}
for file in files:
    for file_type in file_types:
        if file.endswith(file_type):
            shutil.move(source + file, destination + file)
            print("Moved " + file + " to " + destination + file)
```

## Features
- **Automatic File Detection:** Scans source directory for target file types
- **Selective Moving:** Only moves files with specified extensions
- **Progress Feedback:** Reports each file moved with full path
- **Multiple File Types:** Supports text, PDF, and image files
- **Simple Configuration:** Easy to modify file types and directories
- **Error Prevention:** Uses built-in file operations for reliability
- **Completion Notification:** Confirms when all operations are finished

## Supported File Types
The script currently handles these file extensions:
- **Text Files:** .txt
- **PDF Documents:** .pdf
- **Image Files:** .png, .jpg, .jpeg

### Adding More File Types
To support additional file types, simply modify the `file_types` list:
```python title="automatedfilemover.py" showLineNumbers{1}
file_types = ["txt", "pdf", "png", "jpg", "jpeg", "docx", "xlsx", "mp3", "mp4"]
```

## How It Works

### Directory Structure
```
Before Running:
source/
├── document.txt
├── report.pdf
├── photo.png
├── data.csv      (not moved - not in file_types)
└── script.py     (not moved - not in file_types)

destination/
└── (empty)

After Running:
source/
├── data.csv      (remains - not in file_types)
└── script.py     (remains - not in file_types)

destination/
├── document.txt  (moved)
├── report.pdf    (moved)
└── photo.png     (moved)
```

### Process Flow
1. **Scan Source:** Get list of all files in source directory
2. **Filter by Type:** Check each file against target extensions
3. **Move Files:** Transfer matching files to destination
4. **Report Progress:** Print status for each moved file
5. **Complete:** Notify when all operations are finished

## Use Cases
- **Download Organization:** Automatically sort downloaded files
- **Photo Management:** Organize images by moving to specific folders
- **Document Sorting:** Separate documents by type or project
- **Cleanup Tasks:** Remove clutter from working directories
- **Backup Operations:** Move files to backup locations
- **Project Organization:** Sort project files into appropriate folders

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding a GUI interface for directory selection
- Implementing subdirectory organization by file type
- Adding file size filtering and duplicate detection
- Creating scheduled automation with task scheduling
- Adding undo functionality to reverse moves
- Implementing regex patterns for complex file matching
- Adding logging and error handling for failed operations
- Creating configuration files for custom rules
- Adding network drive support for remote file management
- Implementing file compression before moving

## Enhanced Version Ideas
```python title="automatedfilemover.py" showLineNumbers{1}
import logging
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path

class AdvancedFileMover:
    def __init__(self, source_dir, destination_dir):
        self.source = Path(source_dir)
        self.destination = Path(destination_dir)
        self.setup_logging()
    
    def setup_logging(self):
        logging.basicConfig(
            filename='file_moves.log',
            level=logging.INFO,
            format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s'
        )
    
    def organize_by_type(self):
        # Create subdirectories for each file type
        file_type_map = {
            'txt': 'Documents/Text',
            'pdf': 'Documents/PDF',
            'png': 'Images/PNG',
            'jpg': 'Images/JPEG'
        }
        
        for file_type, subfolder in file_type_map.items():
            target_dir = self.destination / subfolder
            target_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    
    def move_with_conflict_resolution(self, source_file, target_file):
        if target_file.exists():
            # Handle file name conflicts
            counter = 1
            while target_file.exists():
                name = target_file.stem
                extension = target_file.suffix
                target_file = target_file.parent / f"{name}_{counter}{extension}"
                counter += 1
        
        shutil.move(str(source_file), str(target_file))
        logging.info(f"Moved {source_file} to {target_file}")
```

## Configuration Options

### Custom Directory Paths
```python title="automatedfilemover.py" showLineNumbers{1}
# Modify these paths as needed
source = "/path/to/your/source/directory/"
destination = "/path/to/your/destination/directory/"

# Or use command line arguments
import sys
if len(sys.argv) > 2:
    source = sys.argv[1]
    destination = sys.argv[2]
```

### File Type Categories
```python title="automatedfilemover.py" showLineNumbers{1}
# Organize by categories
document_types = ["txt", "pdf", "doc", "docx"]
image_types = ["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "bmp"]
video_types = ["mp4", "avi", "mov", "mkv"]
audio_types = ["mp3", "wav", "flac", "aac"]
```

## Error Handling Improvements
```python title="automatedfilemover.py" showLineNumbers{1}
import os
import shutil
import logging

def safe_file_move():
    try:
        for file in files:
            source_path = os.path.join(source, file)
            destination_path = os.path.join(destination, file)
            
            # Check if source file exists
            if not os.path.exists(source_path):
                print(f"Warning: {file} not found in source")
                continue
            
            # Check if destination already exists
            if os.path.exists(destination_path):
                print(f"Warning: {file} already exists in destination")
                continue
            
            # Perform the move
            shutil.move(source_path, destination_path)
            print(f"Successfully moved {file}")
            
    except PermissionError:
        print("Error: Permission denied. Check file permissions.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

## Automation Ideas
- **Schedule Regular Runs:** Use cron (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows)
- **Watch Directory Changes:** Use `watchdog` library for real-time monitoring
- **Email Notifications:** Send reports when file moves are completed
- **Integration:** Combine with other scripts for complete workflow automation

## Security Considerations
- **Path Validation:** Ensure source and destination paths are safe
- **Permission Checks:** Verify read/write access before operations
- **Backup Creation:** Create backups before moving important files
- **Logging:** Maintain records of all file operations

## Educational Value

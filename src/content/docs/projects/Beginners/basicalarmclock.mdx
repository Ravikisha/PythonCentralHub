## Abstract

Build a functional alarm clock application that lets users set a specific time and receive an audio alert when that time arrives. This project demonstrates working with time modules, user input validation, and system audio playbook.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Knowledge of datetime module
- Familiarity with loops and conditional statements

## Getting Started

### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `basicAlarmClock`.
2. Create a new file and name it `basicalarmclock.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into your `basicalarmclock.py` file.

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to your `basicalarmclock.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/basicalarmclock.py" lang="python" title="Basic Alarm Clock" />
2. Save the file.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the following command to run the application.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\basicAlarmClock> python basicalarmclock.py
Enter the time of alarm to be set: HH.MM.SS AM/PM
Enter the time: 02:30:00 PM
Alarm is set for 02:30:00 PM
Waiting for alarm time...
*Alarm sound plays*
Wake Up! Wake Up!
```

## Explanation

1. The `import datetime` statement imports the datetime module for working with dates and times.
2. The `import time` statement imports the time module for adding delays and sleep functionality.
3. The `import winsound` statement imports the Windows sound module for playing audio alerts.
4. The `def alarm(Timing):` function defines the main alarm functionality that takes the alarm time as a parameter.
5. The `while True:` loop continuously checks the current time against the alarm time.
6. The `datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")` gets the current time in HH:MM:SS format.
7. The `if Now == Timing:` condition checks if the current time matches the alarm time.
8. The `winsound.PlaySound()` function plays the alarm sound when the time matches.
9. The `input()` function prompts the user to enter the desired alarm time.
10. The program uses 24-hour time format for setting alarms.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Basic Alarm Clock in Python. Experiment with the code and see if you can modify the application. Here are a few suggestions:
- Add multiple alarm support
- Implement snooze functionality  
- Create GUI interface with Tkinter
- Add custom sound file selection
- Include alarm name/description feature
- Add recurring alarm options (daily, weekly)
- Implement alarm history and logs
- Add volume control for alarms
- Create different alarm tones

## Conclusion

In this project, you learned how to create a Basic Alarm Clock in Python. You also learned how to work with time modules, user input validation, and system audio playback. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ravikisha/PythonCentralHub/blob/main/projects/beginners/basicalarmclock.py)

## Features

- **12-Hour Time Format**: Accepts AM/PM time input
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously checks current time
- **Audio Alerts**: Plays sound when alarm triggers
- **Automatic Termination**: Stops after alarm time passes
- **Simple Interface**: Command-line based interaction

## Next Steps

### Enhancements
- Add multiple alarm support
- Implement snooze functionality
- Create GUI interface with Tkinter
- Add custom sound file selection
- Include alarm name/description feature
- Add recurring alarm options (daily, weekly)
- Implement alarm history and logs

### Learning Extensions
- Study threading for non-blocking alarms
- Explore cross-platform audio libraries
- Learn about system notifications
- Practice with configuration files for settings
- Understand process scheduling and background tasks

## Educational Value

This project teaches:
- **Time Manipulation**: Working with datetime objects and formatting
- **Input Validation**: Parsing and validating time formats
- **System Integration**: Using OS-specific sound capabilities
- **Loop Control**: Implementing monitoring loops with break conditions
- **String Processing**: Extracting and converting time components
- **Real-Time Programming**: Creating responsive time-based applications

Perfect for understanding how time-based applications work and practicing system-level programming concepts.

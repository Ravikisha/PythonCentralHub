## Abstract

Build a fully functional text-based blackjack game that implements classic casino rules, card dealing, betting systems, and game logic. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, game state management, and complex conditional logic.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Solid understanding of Python syntax
- Knowledge of object-oriented programming (classes, objects)
- Familiarity with game logic and conditional statements
- Understanding of loops and user input handling

## Getting Started

### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `blackjackGame`.
2. Create a new file and name it `blackjack.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into your `blackjack.py` file.

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to your `blackjack.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/blackjack.py" lang="python" title="Text-based Blackjack Game" />
2. Save the file.
3. Run the following command to run the application.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\blackjackGame> python blackjack.py
Welcome to BlackJack! Get as close to 21 as you can without going over!
    Dealer hits until she reaches 17. Aces count as 1 or 11.

How many chips would you like to play with? 100
Betting
-------
Current chips: 100
How much chips would you like to bet? 20

Dealer Hand:
<card hidden>
Four of Hearts

Player Hand:
Jack of Spades
Seven of Hearts
Total:  17

Would you like to Hit or Stand? Enter 'h' or 's' s
Dealer Wins!
Player chips total only 80
Would you like to play again? y/n y
```

2. **Run the Blackjack Game**
   ```bash
   python blackjack.py
   ```

```

## Explanation

1. The `import random` statement imports the random module for card shuffling and dealing.
2. The `class Card:` defines individual playing cards with suit and rank attributes.
3. The `class Deck:` creates a full 52-card deck with shuffling functionality.
4. The `class Hand:` manages collections of cards and calculates hand values.
5. The `class Chips:` handles the betting system and chip management.
6. The ace handling logic automatically adjusts ace values from 11 to 1 when needed.
7. The `hit_or_stand()` function handles player decisions during gameplay.
8. The dealer follows standard casino rules (hits until 17 or higher).
9. The game loop allows for multiple rounds of play.
10. Win/loss conditions check for busts, blackjacks, and hand comparisons.
11. The betting system tracks wins and losses with chip adjustments.
12. Input validation ensures proper user responses throughout the game.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Text-based Blackjack Game in Python. Experiment with the code and see if you can modify the application. Here are a few suggestions:
- Add GUI interface with card graphics
- Implement double down and split functionality
- Add insurance betting option
- Create multiplayer support for multiple players
- Add statistics tracking (wins, losses, streaks)
- Implement different difficulty levels
- Add sound effects and animations
- Create tournament mode with multiple rounds
- Add card counting practice features

## Conclusion

In this project, you learned how to create a Text-based Blackjack Game in Python using object-oriented programming. You also learned about game logic, state management, and implementing classic card game rules. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ravikisha/PythonCentralHub/blob/main/projects/beginners/blackjack.py)

## Code Explanation

### Card and Deck Classes
```python
class Card:
    def __init__(self, suit, rank):
        self.suit = suit
        self.rank = rank
    
    def value(self):
        if self.rank in ['Jack', 'Queen', 'King']:
            return 10
        elif self.rank == 'Ace':
            return 11
        else:
            return int(self.rank)
```

Implements card representation with proper value calculation for different card types.

### Hand Management with Ace Handling
```python
class Hand:
    def adjust_for_ace(self):
        while self.value > 21 and self.aces:
            self.value -= 10
            self.aces -= 1
```

Automatically adjusts ace values from 11 to 1 when hand total exceeds 21, implementing classic blackjack ace rules.

### Betting System
```python
class Chips:
    def __init__(self, total=100):
        self.total = total
        self.bet = 0
    
    def win_bet(self):
        self.total += self.bet
    
    def lose_bet(self):
        self.total -= self.bet
```

Manages player's chip count with betting mechanics for wins and losses.

### Game Logic Flow
```python
def hit_or_stand(deck, hand):
    choice = input("Would you like to Hit or Stand? Enter 'h' or 's': ").lower()
    if choice == 'h':
        hit(deck, hand)
    elif choice == 's':
        playing = False
```

Handles player decisions and game state transitions with input validation.

### Dealer AI
```python
if player_hand.value <= 21:
    while dealer_hand.value < 17:
        hit(deck, dealer_hand)
```

Implements standard casino dealer rules (hit until 17 or higher).

### Win/Loss Conditions
```python
if dealer_hand.value > 21:
    dealer_busts(player_hand, dealer_hand, player_chips)
elif dealer_hand.value > player_hand.value:
    dealer_wins(player_hand, dealer_hand, player_chips)
elif dealer_hand.value < player_hand.value:
    player_wins(player_hand, dealer_hand, player_chips)
else:
    push(player_hand, dealer_hand)
```

Evaluates all possible game outcomes with proper chip adjustments.

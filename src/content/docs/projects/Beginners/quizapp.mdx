## Abstract
Basic Quiz Game is an interactive Python application that presents multiple-choice questions about world capitals through a graphical user interface. Built with Tkinter, the application features question navigation, score tracking, answer validation, and various control options including shuffle, reset, and back functionality. This project demonstrates GUI development, data management, user interaction handling, and educational software design principles.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- A code editor or IDE
- tkinter module (usually comes pre-installed)

## Before you Start
Before starting this project, you must have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You must have a code editor or IDE installed on your computer. If you don't have any code editor or IDE installed, you can download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Note: This project uses only built-in Python modules, so no additional installations are required.

## Getting Started
#### Create a Project
1. Create a folder named `quiz-game`.
2. Open the folder in your favorite code editor or IDE.
3. Create a file named `quizapp.py`.
4. Copy the given code and paste it in your `quizapp.py` file.

## Write the Code
1. Copy and paste the following code in your `quizapp.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/quizapp.py" lang="python" title="Basic Quiz Game" />
2. Save the file.
3. Open the terminal in your code editor or IDE and navigate to the folder `quiz-game`.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1-15}
C:\Users\Your Name\quiz-game> python quizapp.py
# A GUI window will open with:
# - Question display area
# - Four multiple-choice radio buttons
# - Navigation buttons (Next, Back, Reset, Shuffle)
# - Show Score button
# - Score tracking functionality

# Example quiz flow:
Question 1: "What is the Capital of India?"
Options: New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai
Select answer → Click Next → Continue to next question
Final Score: "Your Score is 8/10"
```

## Explanation

### Code Structure Overview
The quiz application is organized into several key components:

1. **Data Structure:** Questions, options, and answers arrays
2. **GUI Components:** Labels, radio buttons, and control buttons
3. **Navigation Logic:** Forward/backward movement through questions
4. **Score Management:** Tracking correct answers and displaying results

### Data Setup
1. **Import modules and create main window.**
```python title="quizapp.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-8}
from tkinter import *
from tkinter import messagebox
import random

root = Tk()
root.title("Quiz App")
root.geometry("500x500")
root.resizable(0, 0)
```

2. **Initialize quiz data structures.**
```python title="quizapp.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-10}
questions = [
    "What is the Capital of India?",
    "What is the Capital of USA?",
    "What is the Capital of UK?",
    # ... more questions
]

options = [
    ["New Delhi", "Mumbai", "Kolkata", "Chennai"],
    ["New York", "Washington DC", "California", "Texas"],
    # ... corresponding options
]

answers = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  # Index of correct answers
```

3. **Core navigation and scoring logic.**
```python title="quizapp.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-15}
def selected():
    global ans, ques_num, score, ans_list
    if ques_num == 10:
        submit.config(text="Finish")
    if ans == answers[ques_num - 1]:
        score += 1
        ans_list.append(1)
    else:
        ans_list.append(0)
    ques_num += 1
    ques.config(text=questions[ques_num - 1])
    for i in range(4):
        radio[i].config(text=options[ques_num - 1][i])
    if ques_num == 11:
        messagebox.showinfo("Score", f"Your Score is {score}")
        root.destroy()
```

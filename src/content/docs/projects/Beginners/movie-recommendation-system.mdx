- **Statistical Dashboard**: Database statistics and trends
- **Genre Analysis**: Most popular genres and distributions
- **User Profiles**: Personal rating history and preferences

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Class Structure
```python
class Movie:
    def __init__(self, movie_id, title, genres, year=None):
        # Movie metadata and rating management
        # Automatic rating calculations
    
    def add_rating(self, rating):
        # Add user rating and update averages
    
    def to_dict(self):
        # Serialize movie data for storage

class User:
    def __init__(self, user_id, name):
        # User profile and rating management
        # Favorite genre tracking
    
    def rate_movie(self, movie_id, rating):
        # Rate a movie and update preferences
    
    def update_favorite_genres(self, movies):
        # Analyze ratings to determine favorite genres

class MovieRecommendationSystem:
    def __init__(self, data_file="movie_data.json"):
        # Initialize system with data persistence
        # Load existing data or create sample data
```

### Key Algorithms

#### Collaborative Filtering
```python
def calculate_user_similarity(self, user1_id, user2_id):
    # Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient
    # Find users with similar rating patterns
    # Return similarity score between -1 and 1

def get_user_based_recommendations(self, user_id, limit=10):
    # Find similar users
    # Aggregate recommendations from similar users
    # Weight recommendations by user similarity
    # Return top-rated movies from similar users
```

#### Content-Based Filtering
```python
def get_content_based_recommendations(self, user_id, limit=10):
    # Analyze user's favorite genres
    # Score unrated movies based on genre preferences
    # Consider movie ratings and popularity
    # Return movies matching user's taste profile
```

#### Hybrid Approach
```python
def get_hybrid_recommendations(self, user_id, limit=10):
    # Combine collaborative and content-based recommendations
    # Apply weighted scoring (70% collaborative, 30% content-based)
    # Merge and rank final recommendations
    # Return diverse, personalized suggestions
```

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
2. **Run the System**:
   ```bash
   python movierecommendationsystem.py
   ```

3. **Getting Started**:
   - Register as a new user or login with existing ID
   - Browse and rate some movies to build your profile
   - Get personalized recommendations
   - Explore different recommendation types

## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# Create recommendation system
system = MovieRecommendationSystem()

# Add a new user
user = system.add_user("John Doe")

# Rate some movies
system.rate_movie(user.id, 1, 5.0)  # Love "The Shawshank Redemption"
system.rate_movie(user.id, 3, 4.5)  # Really like "The Dark Knight"
system.rate_movie(user.id, 6, 4.0)  # Enjoy "Inception"

# Get recommendations
recommendations = system.get_hybrid_recommendations(user.id, 5)
for movie in recommendations:
    print(f"Recommended: {movie}")
```

### Advanced Features
```python
# Find similar users
similarity = system.calculate_user_similarity(user1_id, user2_id)
print(f"User similarity: {similarity:.2f}")

# Get genre-specific movies
action_movies = system.get_movies_by_genre("Action")

# Search for movies
search_results = system.search_movies("dark knight")

# Get top-rated movies
top_movies = system.get_top_rated_movies(10, min_ratings=5)
```

### Analytics
```python
# Get comprehensive statistics
stats = system.get_movie_statistics()
print(f"Total movies: {stats['total_movies']}")
print(f"Most popular genres: {stats['most_common_genres']}")
```

## Abstract

Create a fully functional todo list application that allows users to add, view, delete, and manage tasks through a command-line interface. The application features persistent file storage, comprehensive task management operations, and user-friendly confirmation dialogs.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Knowledge of file operations (read, write, append)
- Familiarity with lists and string manipulation
- Understanding of control structures and loops

## Getting Started

### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `todoListApp`.
2. Create a new file and name it `todo.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into your `todo.py` file.

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to your `todo.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/todo.py" lang="python" title="Todo List Application" />
2. Save the file.
3. Run the following command to run the application.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\todoListApp> python todo.py
----------TO DO LIST----------
1. Add task
2. Delete task
3. Show task
4. exit
enter the choice: 1
enter the task: Buy groceries
Task Added Successfully.

enter the choice: 3
1: Buy groceries

enter the choice: 4
```

3. **Use the Application**
   - Choose operations from the main menu (1-4, E, R, H)
   - Add tasks with descriptive names
   - View your current task list
   - Delete individual tasks or clear all tasks

## Code Explanation

### File-Based Persistence
```python
def add_task():
    task = input("Enter Task: ")
    with open("todo.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(task + "\n")
    print("Task Added Successfully.")
```

Uses text file storage to maintain tasks between application sessions, ensuring data persistence.

### Task Viewing with Numbering
```python
def view_task():
    with open("todo.txt", "r") as f:
        tasks = f.readlines()
        if len(tasks) == 0:
            print("No Tasks Found.")
        else:
            for i in range(len(tasks)):
                print(str(i + 1) + ". " + tasks[i].strip("\n"))
```

Displays tasks in a numbered list format for easy reference and selection.

### Safe Task Deletion
```python
def delete_task():
    with open("todo.txt", "r") as f:
        tasks = f.readlines()
        # Display current tasks
        task_no = int(input("Enter Task Number to Delete: "))
        if task_no > len(tasks):
            print("Invalid Task Number.")
        else:
            del tasks[task_no - 1]
            with open("todo.txt", "w") as f:
                for task in tasks:
                    f.write(task)
```

Implements safe task removal with validation and immediate file updates.

### Confirmation Dialogs
```python
def delete_all_task():
    confirm = input("Are you sure you want to delete all tasks? (Y/N): ")
    if confirm in ("Y", "y"):
        with open("todo.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write("")
        print("All Tasks Deleted Successfully.")
```

Provides user confirmation for destructive operations to prevent accidental data loss.

### Application Control
```python
def exit():
    confirm = input("Are you sure you want to exit? (Y/N): ")
    if confirm in ("Y", "y"):
        print("Exiting...")
        time.sleep(1)
        sys.exit()
```

Manages application lifecycle with graceful exit confirmation.

### Main Program Loop
```python
while True:
    choice = input("Enter Choice (1/2/3/4/E/R/H): ")
    if choice == "1":
        add_task()
    elif choice == "2":
        view_task()
    # ... other choices
```

Implements continuous operation loop with clear menu options and input validation.

## Features

- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks saved to file system survive application restarts
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear menu system with numbered options
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid choices and task numbers gracefully
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevents accidental deletion of tasks
- **Help System**: Built-in help explaining all available operations
- **Application Control**: Exit and restart functionality with confirmations

## Next Steps

### Enhancements
- Add task due dates and reminders
- Implement task priorities (high, medium, low)
- Create task categories or tags
- Add task completion status tracking
- Implement search and filter functionality
- Create backup and restore features
- Add task editing capabilities
- Include task creation timestamps

### Learning Extensions
- Study database integration (SQLite)
- Explore GUI development with Tkinter
- Learn about task scheduling with datetime
- Practice with JSON data storage
- Understand regular expressions for search
- Explore web-based todo applications

## Educational Value

This project teaches:
- **File I/O Operations**: Reading from and writing to text files
- **Data Persistence**: Maintaining application data between sessions
- **CRUD Operations**: Implementing complete data management functionality
- **Input Validation**: Handling user input safely and providing feedback
- **Application Architecture**: Organizing code into focused functions
- **User Experience**: Creating intuitive command-line interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Managing edge cases and invalid operations
- **Control Flow**: Managing complex program flow with menus and confirmations

Perfect for understanding data management, file operations, and user interface design in console applications.

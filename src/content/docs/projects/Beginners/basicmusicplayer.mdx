## Abstract

Create a fully functional music player application with a graphical user interface that supports playlist management, playback controls (play, pause, stop, resume), directory loading, and visual feedback. This project combines GUI development with audio processing capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Knowledge of Tkinter for GUI development
- Familiarity with file system operations
- Understanding of event-driven programming

## Getting Started

### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `basicMusicPlayer`.
2. Create a new file and name it `basicmusicplayer.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into your `basicmusicplayer.py` file.

### Install required dependencies
1. Install pygame for audio handling:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to your `basicmusicplayer.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/basicmusicplayer.py" lang="python" title="Basic Music Player" />
2. Save the file.
3. Prepare some music files in a folder.
4. Run the following command to run the application.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\basicMusicPlayer> python basicmusicplayer.py
[Music Player GUI Opens]
- Click "Load" to browse and select music folder
- Select songs from the playlist
- Use Play, Pause, Stop, Resume buttons
- Current song and status displayed at top
```

1. **Install Required Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   # tkinter comes built-in with Python
   ```

2. **Prepare Music Files**
   - Create a folder with music files (MP3, WAV, etc.)
   - Ensure files are in supported audio formats

3. **Run the Music Player**
   ```bash
   python basicmusicplayer.py
   ```

4. **Load Music Directory**
   - Click "Load Directory" button
   - Select folder containing your music files
   ```

## Explanation

1. The `import pygame.mixer as mixer` statement imports the Pygame mixer module for audio playback.
2. The `mixer.init()` function initializes the audio system for playing music files.
3. The `from tkinter import *` imports all Tkinter components for creating the GUI.
4. The `from tkinter import filedialog` imports the file dialog for browsing directories.
5. The `song_frame = LabelFrame()` creates a labeled frame to display the current song.
6. The `button_frame = LabelFrame()` creates a frame for organizing control buttons.
7. The `listbox_frame = LabelFrame()` creates a frame for the playlist display.
8. The `def play_song()` function handles music playback and status updates.
9. The `def pause_song()` function pauses the current song and updates status.
10. The `def load()` function opens a directory browser to load music files.
11. The `playlist = Listbox()` creates a scrollable list for managing songs.
12. The control buttons (Play, Pause, Stop, Resume) provide music player functionality.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Basic Music Player in Python. Experiment with the code and see if you can modify the application. Here are a few suggestions:
- Add volume control slider
- Implement shuffle and repeat modes
- Add song information display (duration, artist, album)
- Create playlist saving and loading functionality
- Add keyboard shortcuts for controls
- Implement music visualization
- Add support for more audio formats
- Create custom themes and skins
- Add favorite songs functionality

## Conclusion

In this project, you learned how to create a Basic Music Player in Python using Tkinter and Pygame. You also learned about GUI development, audio processing, and event-driven programming.

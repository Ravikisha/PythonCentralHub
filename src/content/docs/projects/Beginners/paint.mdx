## Abstract

Build a feature-rich digital painting application with a graphical interface that includes color palettes, brush size controls, eraser tools, canvas background customization, and image saving capabilities. This project demonstrates advanced GUI development, event handling, and image processing.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Knowledge of Tkinter for GUI development
- Familiarity with event-driven programming
- Understanding of coordinate systems and graphics
- Basic knowledge of image processing concepts

## Getting Started

<Steps>

1. **Install Required Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   # tkinter comes built-in with Python
   ```

2. **Run the Paint Application**
   ```bash
   python paint.py
   ```

3. **Start Creating Art**
   - Select colors from the color palette
   - Adjust brush size with the scale control
   - Use the eraser tool for corrections
   - Save your artwork when finished

</Steps>

## Code Explanation

### Application Architecture
```python title="paint.py" showLineNumbers{1}
class Paint:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Paint")
        self.root.geometry("800x520")
        self.pen_color = "black"
        self.eraser_color = "white"
```

Implements a class-based structure for better organization and state management of the painting application.

### Event-Driven Drawing
```python title="paint.py" showLineNumbers{1}
self.root.bind("<B1-Motion>", self.paint)
self.root.bind("<ButtonRelease-1>", self.reset)

def paint(self, event):
    x1, y1 = (event.x-2), (event.y-2)
    x2, y2 = (event.x+2), (event.y+2)
    self.canvas.create_oval(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill=self.pen_color, 
                           outline=self.pen_color, width=self.canvas_width.get())
```

Captures mouse movement and button events to create continuous drawing by placing small overlapping ovals.

### Dynamic Color Palette
```python title="paint.py" showLineNumbers{1}
colors = ["#ff0000", "#ff4000", "#ff8000", "#ffbf00", "#ffff00", ...]
i=j=0
for color in colors:
    Button(self.color_frame, bg=color, bd=2, relief=RIDGE, width=3, 
           command=lambda col=color:self.select_color(col)).grid(row=i, column=j)
```

Creates a comprehensive color palette with buttons arranged in a grid layout for easy color selection.

### Brush Size Control
```python title="paint.py" showLineNumbers{1}
self.canvas_width = Scale(self.root, from_=1, to=100, orient=VERTICAL)
self.canvas_width.set(1)
```

Provides a vertical scale widget for real-time brush size adjustment from 1 to 100 pixels.

### Canvas Background Customization
```python title="paint.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def canvas_color(self):
    color = colorchooser.askcolor(title="Select Color")
    self.canvas.configure(background=color[1])
    self.eraser_color = color[1]
```

Allows users to change the canvas background color and automatically updates the eraser color to match.

### Image Saving with Screen Capture
```python title="paint.py" showLineNumbers{1}
def save_paint(self):
    filename = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension=".jpg")
    x = self.root.winfo_rootx() + self.canvas.winfo_x()
    y = self.root.winfo_rooty() + self.canvas.winfo_y()
    x1 = x + self.canvas.winfo_width()
    y1 = y + self.canvas.winfo_height()
    PIL.ImageGrab.grab().crop((x,y,x1,y1)).save(filename)
```

Implements screen capture technology to save the canvas content as an image file.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Color Palette**: 27 predefined colors in an organized grid
- **Variable Brush Size**: Adjustable brush width from 1 to 100 pixels
- **Eraser Tool**: Switch between drawing and erasing modes
- **Canvas Customization**: Change background color with color picker
- **Clear Function**: Reset the entire canvas instantly
- **Image Saving**: Save artwork as JPEG files
- **Responsive Drawing**: Smooth, continuous brush strokes
- **Professional Layout**: Organized toolbar and spacious canvas area

## Next Steps

### Enhancements
- Add different brush shapes (square, triangle, spray)
- Implement undo/redo functionality
- Create layers support for complex artwork
- Add text tool for adding labels
- Implement zoom in/out functionality
- Add image loading capabilities
- Create brush opacity controls
- Add selection tools (rectangle, lasso)

### Learning Extensions
- Study advanced image processing with PIL/Pillow
- Explore vector graphics programming
- Learn about graphics algorithms and optimization
- Practice with custom widget development
- Understand color theory and digital art concepts
- Explore tablet/stylus input integration

## Educational Value

This project teaches:
- **Advanced GUI Development**: Creating complex interfaces with multiple widget types
- **Event Handling**: Managing mouse events for interactive drawing
- **Image Processing**: Working with PIL for screen capture and image manipulation
- **Coordinate Systems**: Understanding pixel-based positioning and drawing
- **State Management**: Maintaining application state across user interactions
- **File Operations**: Implementing save/load functionality with file dialogs

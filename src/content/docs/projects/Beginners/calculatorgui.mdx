## Abstract

Create a fully functional calculator with a graphical user interface that supports basic arithmetic operations, decimal numbers, error handling, and clear functionality. This project demonstrates GUI design, event handling, and mathematical expression evaluation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Knowledge of Tkinter for GUI development
- Familiarity with arithmetic operations
- Understanding of event-driven programming

## Getting Started

### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `calculatorGUI`.
2. Create a new file and name it `calculatorgui.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into your `calculatorgui.py` file.

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to your `calculatorgui.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/calculatorgui.py" lang="python" title="Calculator GUI" />
2. Save the file.
3. Run the following command to run the application.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\calculatorGUI> python calculatorgui.py
[Calculator GUI Opens]
- Click number buttons to input values
- Click operation buttons (+, -, *, /) for calculations
- Click "=" to get the result
- Click "Clear" to reset the calculator
Example: 5 + 3 = 8
```

```

## Explanation

1. The `from tkinter import *` statement imports all Tkinter components for creating the GUI.
2. The `solution = ""` creates a global variable to store the current mathematical expression.
3. The `equation = StringVar()` creates a Tkinter string variable for the display.
4. The `def press(num):` function handles button presses and updates the expression.
5. The `def equalpress():` function evaluates the mathematical expression using eval().
6. The `def clear():` function resets the calculator by clearing the expression.
7. The `gui = Tk()` creates the main window for the calculator.
8. The `expression_field = Entry()` creates the display field for showing expressions and results.
9. The number buttons (0-9) are created with lambda functions to pass their values.
10. The operation buttons (+, -, *, /) handle arithmetic operations.
11. The grid layout system organizes buttons in a calculator-style arrangement.
12. Error handling displays "error" when invalid expressions are entered.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Calculator GUI in Python. Experiment with the code and see if you can modify the application. Here are a few suggestions:
- Add advanced mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt)
- Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- Add keyboard input support
- Create a history feature to track calculations
- Implement bracket support for complex expressions
- Add a scientific calculator mode
- Create different themes and color schemes
- Add sound effects for button presses
- Implement percentage calculations

## Conclusion

In this project, you learned how to create a Calculator GUI in Python using Tkinter. You also learned about GUI design, event handling, and mathematical expression evaluation. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ravikisha/PythonCentralHub/blob/main/projects/beginners/calculatorgui.py)

## Code Explanation

### Global State Management
```python
solution = ""

def press(num):
    global solution
    solution = solution + str(num)
    equation.set(solution)
```

Maintains the current expression as a global string, updating the display whenever new input is added.

### Expression Evaluation
```python
def equalpress():
    try:
        global solution
        total = str(eval(solution))
        equation.set(total)
        solution = ""
    except:
        equation.set(" error ")
        solution = ""
```

Uses Python's `eval()` function to calculate mathematical expressions with proper error handling for invalid operations.

### GUI Layout with Grid System
```python
gui = Tk()
gui.configure(background="light green")
gui.title("Calculator")
gui.geometry("270x150")

expression_field = Entry(gui, textvariable=equation)
expression_field.grid(columnspan=4, ipadx=70)
```

Creates a structured calculator layout using Tkinter's grid system for organized button placement.

### Number and Operation Buttons
```python
button1 = Button(gui, text=' 1 ', fg='black', bg='gray',
                 command=lambda: press(1), height=1, width=7)
button1.grid(row=2, column=0)

plus = Button(gui, text=' + ', fg='black', bg='gray',
              command=lambda: press("+"), height=1, width=7)
plus.grid(row=2, column=3)
```

Implements individual buttons for numbers (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /) with lambda functions for command handling.

### Clear Functionality
```python
def clear():
    global solution
    solution = ""
    equation.set("")
```

Provides a reset function to clear both the current expression and the display.

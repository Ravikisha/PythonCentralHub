## Abstract

Challenge yourself against an AI in a number guessing game! The AI uses binary search to guess your number, then you try to guess the AI's number. Compare rounds to see who wins and learn about efficient algorithms in action.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Understanding of loops and input/output
- Familiarity with binary search (helpful)

## Getting Started

### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `numberGuessingWithAI`.
2. Create a new file and name it `numberguessingwithai.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into your `numberguessingwithai.py` file.

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to your `numberguessingwithai.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/numberguessingwithai.py" lang="python" title="Number Guessing Game with AI" />
2. Save the file.
3. Run the following command to run the application.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\numberGuessingWithAI> python numberguessingwithai.py
Think of a number between 0 and 100!
Is your number 50? (h/l/y): h
Is your number 75? (h/l/y): l
Is your number 62? (h/l/y): l
Is your number 56? (h/l/y): y
I guessed your number in 4 rounds!
Now guess my number between 0 and 100:
50
Too low! Try again: 75
Too high! Try again: 62
Correct! You guessed my number in 3 rounds!
You win this round!
```

## Explanation

1. The `import random` statement imports the random module for generating random numbers.
2. The AI uses binary search algorithm to efficiently guess your number.
3. The `low` and `high` variables maintain the search range for the AI.
4. The AI starts by guessing the middle value (50) and adjusts based on your response.
5. Your responses ('h' for higher, 'l' for lower, 'y' for yes) guide the AI's search.
6. The `random.randint(0, 100)` generates a random number for you to guess.
7. The program tracks rounds taken by both AI and human player.
8. Winner determination compares the number of rounds each player needed.
9. The binary search algorithm guarantees the AI will find any number in at most 7 rounds.
10. The game demonstrates the efficiency of algorithmic problem-solving vs. human intuition.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Number Guessing Game with AI in Python. Experiment with the code and see if you can modify the application. Here are a few suggestions:
- Add difficulty levels (change range from 0-100 to larger ranges)
- Track high scores and statistics across multiple games
- Add GUI with Tkinter for better user experience
- Let AI learn from previous games to improve performance
- Implement different AI strategies (random, pattern-based)
- Add multiplayer support for multiple human players
- Create tournament mode with best-of-series gameplay
- Add sound effects and visual feedback
- Implement hints system for human player

## Conclusion

In this project, you learned how to create a Number Guessing Game with AI in Python. You also learned about binary search algorithms, human vs. computer problem-solving, and competitive programming concepts.

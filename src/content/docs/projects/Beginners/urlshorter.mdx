## Abstract
URL Shortener is a simple Python application that converts long URLs into short, manageable links using the `pyshorteners` library. The application supports multiple URL shortening services including TinyURL and Bitly. This project demonstrates working with external APIs, URL manipulation, and third-party libraries. Users can input a long URL and receive a shortened version that redirects to the original link, making it perfect for sharing on social media or in constrained spaces.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- A code editor or IDE
- pyshorteners module
- Internet connection

## Before you Start
Before starting this project, you must have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You must have a code editor or IDE installed on your computer. If you don't have any code editor or IDE installed, you can download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). You must have the pyshorteners module installed on your computer. You can install it using the following command:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
C:\Users\Your Name>pip install pyshorteners
```

For Bitly integration (optional), you'll need to:
1. Create a free account at [Bitly](https://bitly.com/)
2. Get your API key from the Bitly developer dashboard
3. Replace the placeholder API key in the code

## Getting Started
#### Create a Project
1. Create a folder named `url-shortener`.
2. Open the folder in your favorite code editor or IDE.
3. Create a file named `urlshorter.py`.
4. Copy the given code and paste it in your `urlshorter.py` file.

## Write the Code
1. Copy and paste the following code in your `urlshorter.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/urlshorter.py" lang="python" title="URL Shortener" />
2. Save the file.
3. Open the terminal in your code editor or IDE and navigate to the folder `url-shortener`.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1-10}
C:\Users\Your Name\url-shortener> python urlshorter.py
Enter URL: https://www.example.com/very/long/url/with/many/parameters?param1=value1&param2=value2
Short URL:  https://tinyurl.com/abc123def

C:\Users\Your Name\url-shortener> python urlshorter.py
Enter URL: https://github.com/Ravikisha/PythonCentralHub
Short URL:  https://tinyurl.com/pythonhub123
```

## Explanation
1. Import the required module.
```python title="urlshorter.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
import pyshorteners # pip install pyshorteners
```

2. Get the URL input from the user.
```python title="urlshorter.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
url = input("Enter URL: ")
```

3. Create a shortener object and generate short URL using TinyURL.
```python title="urlshorter.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
shortener = pyshorteners.Shortener()
shortURL = shortener.tinyurl.short(url)
```

4. Alternative Bitly implementation (commented out).
```python title="urlshorter.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
# bitlyShortener = pyshorteners.Shortener(api_key='your_api_key_here')
# shortURL = bitlyShortener.bitly.short(url)
```

5. Display the shortened URL.
```python title="urlshorter.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
print("Short URL: ", shortURL)
```

## Supported Services
This URL shortener supports multiple services:

### TinyURL (Default)
- **Pros:** No API key required, simple to use
- **Cons:** Limited customization options
- **Usage:** Included in the default code

### Bitly
- **Pros:** Custom short URLs, analytics, branded links
- **Cons:** Requires API key registration
- **Usage:** Uncomment the Bitly section and add your API key

### Other Supported Services
The `pyshorteners` library also supports:
- Is.gd
- V.gd
- QR.net
- Chilp.it
- Clck.ru
- And many more!

## Features
- Convert long URLs to short, shareable links
- Support for multiple URL shortening services
- Simple command-line interface
- No database required
- Instant URL conversion
- Works with any valid HTTP/HTTPS URL
- Cross-platform compatibility

## How to Use
1. Run the application
2. Enter the long URL you want to shorten
3. Press Enter to get the shortened URL
4. Copy and share the short URL
5. The short URL will redirect to the original long URL when clicked

## API Key Setup (For Bitly)
To use Bitly services:
1. Visit [Bitly Developer](https://dev.bitly.com/)
2. Create a free account
3. Generate an API access token
4. Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual API key
5. Uncomment the Bitly code section

## Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:
- Adding a GUI interface using Tkinter
- Creating a web application using Flask
- Implementing URL validation
- Adding custom short URL aliases
- Creating a URL history database
- Adding QR code generation for short URLs
- Implementing click analytics
- Adding bulk URL shortening
- Creating browser extension integration

## Error Handling
Consider adding error handling for:
- Invalid URLs
- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limits
- Service unavailability

Example enhanced version:
```python title="urlshorter.py" showLineNumbers{1}
try:
    shortURL = shortener.tinyurl.short(url)
    print("Short URL: ", shortURL)
except Exception as e:
    print("Error creating short URL:", str(e))
```

## Conclusion
In this project, we learned how to create a URL Shortener using Python and the `pyshorteners` library. We explored working with external APIs, URL manipulation, and third-party service integration. This project demonstrates how to leverage existing services to create useful applications quickly and efficiently. The skills learned here can be applied to other API-based projects and web service integrations. To find more projects like this, you can visit Python Central Hub.
